            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>This emboldens the Author (who was the firſt Perſon employ'd in your Service for your Foreign Expedition, and the firſt who left it) to lay the following Sheets at your Feet. And he takes upon him to put you in Mind, that if you had not miſapply'd the Money intruſted to your Management (the Want whereof is ſo much felt at Home by the great Number of needy Perſons, who expected their Dividends before now.) And if you had liſten'd to the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Advice of Mr. <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> an eminent and experienc'd Man in <hi>India,</hi> who offer'd himſelf for your Pilot, and his Subſtance for your Security, which was more than the Three beſt Shares in your Capital Stock; and had not been bewitch'd to the Golden Dreams of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon</hi> the Pedlar, Tub-preacher, and at laſt Whimſical Projector; you might e'er now have been poſſeſt of a good Colony in <hi>India,</hi> where no Body could diſturb you: And not have run on an Airy Project, which (altho' you ſhould have met with an Oppoſition from the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard)</hi> four times your Capital Stock could not have brought to any reaſonable Pitch of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the End. And had you been Maſters of ſo much Management and Temper, as to have ſav'd that Fifty Thouſand Pounds, which you ſquander'd away on thoſe Six Hulks you built at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> purely to make a Noiſe there of your Proceedings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:45975:4"/>you thought to decoy the innocent <hi>Dutch</hi> Men, or at leaſt their Gelt, into your Net; and had therewith bought a Couple of Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand Ships in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and diſpatch'd them to <hi>India</hi> with a ſuitable Cargoe, (not of <hi>Scotch</hi> Cloth, Slippers, Periwigs and Bibles) you might have had ſuch Returns e'er now, as would have buoy'd you up ſo far above Water, as you needed not proclaim to the ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling World ſo many publick Ropings of the Shares of your Capital Stock.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>WILLIAM</hi> the Second, who, as you ſay, in an untainted Line, is the 112th King that hath wore your Regal Diadem, has wrought and fought ſufficiently for the Gift, your Nation prudently thought their Intereſt to make him. Or admit it ſhould be true, that there was no private Intereſt conſulted by thoſe generous <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,</hi> yet it is obvious to the World, that by being Subjects of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> you are not only ſhaded from the Inſults of all Nations, but by the Authority of your <hi>Britiſh</hi> Sovereign, you are freed from the daily Feuds, and bloody little Wars, which, before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for a Tract of Time, not leſs than <hi>1900</hi> Years, were continually raging amongſt your ſelves; which unnatural Maſſacres your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Princes were ſo unable to ſuppreſs, that when the contending Clans or Parties were glutted with one anothers Blood, and deſir'd the Benefit of the Princely Mediation; thoſe were pleas'd to accept of the Office of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, in Patching up the Feuds, till ſuch time as the young Fry came of Age, to fight it out. Theſe Barbarities have been quite turn'd out of Doors ſince the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and they are now, either almoſt or altogether forgot; neither are they to be reviv'd, unleſs it be by
<pb facs="tcp:45975:5"/>this ſo-much-wiſh'd-for Separation of Three or Four Months Date. Your People now enjoy the Bleſſings of Heaven, and Product of the Earth, and Ocean without any interruption; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as formerly they liv'd on the Mountains, and under the Shelter of ſome ſtrong Rocks or Caſtles, they are now come down to the Plains, and can ſleep ſound in Beds, without the leaſt Apprehenſion of Blood and Rapine. And to Crown your Felicity, you have now a free En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Goſpel, in the Fulneſs and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereof, which has ever been reckon'd the chief Care and Bleſſing of all Political Bodies. You are at Liberty to ſay your Prayers, either in Form, or out of Form, which you pleaſe, without any Dread of Sophiſtical Impoſitions by Romiſh or Malignant Prieſts. And now you praiſe your Maker in ſtately Churches, whereas, formerly theſe gallant Men, your Anceſtors, were oblig'd to offer on ſuch Altars as <hi>Jacob</hi> made, and to whiſper their Prayers or Carrols through the Cliffs of the Mountains, or the Chimney of ſome Houſe, whoſe Wall was ſome Twelve or Fourteen Foot thick. All theſe Bleſſings you owe to Heaven, and the Britiſh Monarchy, whatever ſome vitiated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd Palates perſwade you to the Contrary.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45975:5"/>
                  <p>The mask'd <hi>Champion</hi> of your Company, whoſe Tongue is much too big for his Mouth, is in Pain becauſe he cannot ſpurt out all his Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom at one Blaſt. However reaſonable it be, that the Gentleman's Zeal ſhould atone for his want of Power, yet I muſt acquaint you, that his Quarrel with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and groundleſs, as your Settling a Colony in another Man's Dominions; unleſs by Virtue of your Presbyterian Tenent, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Dominions being founded in Grace,</hi> you who are the Preſumptive Elect pretend a Divine Right to the Goods of the Wicked, and ſo take upon you to cloath the Seven Councellors of your Colony with ſuch another Commiſſion, as God gave the <hi>Hebrews</hi> when they departed out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have no Inclination to offer any Thing in Oppoſition to the Gallantry of your Anceſtors, who took ſo much Care to keep themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of another Nation. And altho' I pretend to know the Thread of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Story full as well as the Author of the Defence, yet out of Reſpect to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where I drew my firſt Breath (tho' I owe it nothing elſe) I will offer nothing to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of it's Ancient Fame: But if I point at ſome Errata's of this Author, I do it purely to reconcile Miſtakes, and to make a Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company, and <hi>Scots</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45975:6"/>Nation; I being ſo much the Latter's Friend, as to wiſh them not to embrak in ſo rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Bottom as this of your Company, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you are on an honeſter Footing than you appear to be at preſent, that the Honour of the Ancient Kingdom mayn't be ſully'd with ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious a Miſtake. I ſhall only ſay in Anſwer to this Paragraph, that altho' your Anceſtors were never ſparing of their Blood in defending their Country, nay, oftimes in making Reprizal when they could conveniently; yet I muſt put you in mind, that they were far better pleas'd with enjoying themſelves in their old <hi>Caledonian</hi> Mountains, than you are now with both Hills and Plains: And I dare ſay, they had ſuch a Value for their Native Blood, that they would not have been guilty of ſending ſo many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and worthy Gentlemen (like Sheep to the Slaughter, or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mines) ſo far from Home on ſuch an <hi>April</hi> Errand.</p>
                  <p>'Tis both hard and unaccountable that this Gentleman, who ſets up for your Champion, ſhould uſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation ſo familiarly, and take ſuch Liberty, not only of frightning them into an Ague, but to Bully a great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who was never hitherto known to be daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by more formidable Giants, than the <hi>Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots</hi> of your Company. He, honeſt Gentleman, mean'd no Harm at the Granting of the <hi>Oct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy;</hi> for, 'tis to be believed, that he could

And as for this Project of yours to <hi>Darien,</hi> I dare be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that he knew nothing of the Matter till it was Five or Six Months done; and then he had it from other Hands.</p>
                  <p>If your Colony has left <hi>Darien</hi> for Reaſons not as yet publick to the World, 'tis your Fault, <hi>Right Worſhipful Gentlemen,</hi> in underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to manage a Project you ſo little underſtood, and not of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, whoſe Intereſt it is to advance and preſerve their own Colonies, and to keep them from being render'd deſolate by the Clandeſtine Artiſices of yours, who induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and tacitely ſpread their Declarations over all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Iſlands and Plantations, making uſe of the King of <hi>Great Britain's</hi> Name, to give the more Authority to the Thing: And by theſe indirect <hi>Manifeſto's,</hi> ſuch Proſits, or rather Plunders were inſinuated; that if the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> had not taken early Meaſures to prevent the ill Conſequences, 'tis to be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, whether the greateſt Part of the <hi>Engliſh Weſt-Indies</hi> had not e'er now quitted their Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, and been decoy'd into your Colony, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Cover'd Notion, that you had a Patent from the King, to pick a Quarrel with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard;</hi> and to devide the Spoil of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> amongſt the Servants and Adventures of the Company.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45975:7"/>
                  <p>This Project and Settlement, you know, was ſo ſecretly carried on, that it was not known to <hi>England,</hi> till the ſame Wind that brought the News likewiſe, inform'd the Nation, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were march'd over to <hi>Panama</hi> (the chief City on the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien,</hi> and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury-Chamber of all the <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> Riches on the South-Sea) and had planted Eighty Guns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Theſe Proceedings were enough to ſtartle this Nation, who had heard of no War with <hi>Spain,</hi> and who had no great Reaſon to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their own Subjects to deſert their Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to advance the <hi>Scotch</hi> Colony in their own Wrong. As for this Nation's curing into a War with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> on the Score of your Company, who beſides their Loſs of Trade, muſt throw away more <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pounds (thrice over) than there's <hi>Scotch,</hi> in your Capital Stock; I'll leave it to any Man of Half an Ounce of Politicks, to find out the Jeſt on't, ſave this Hot-headed Author of your Colony's Defence.</p>
                  <p>As for theſe ridiculous and bugbear Stories, which both you and your Champion inſinuate, <hi>viz.</hi> that if the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould loſe, or be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd out of <hi>Darien,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly poſſeſs themſelves of it. This Story is ſo far vain, that the <hi>French</hi> have another Game to play at preſent with <hi>Spain;</hi> and if they had any ſuch Inclination that Way, they know that Coaſt far better than the <hi>Scots,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45975:7"/>and might have ſecur'd <hi>Carthagena,</hi> when they had it in their Power, and a Legal Title to it by their Arms in the Time of a declar'd War: Which Fortification is as far before your Fort St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> or any Thing that can be made of it; as <hi>Dunkirk</hi> is before <hi>Deale</hi>-Caſtle. But ſtill, if <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> had any ſuch Deſign (as you would make the World believe) why mayn't they ſtill go ſit down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a League of either Side of your Colony with as good a Title as yours, ſince you will coop the <hi>Spaniard</hi> up within his Wall'd Towns and Garriſons. But to leave this unneceſſary Diſpute.—</p>
                  <p>And proceed to the oblique Threatnings wherewith he frightens King <hi>William,</hi> to wit, the Fate of thoſe Mean-ſpirited Princes, who blemiſh'd, and were unworthy to wear the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown of your Nation; I'll eſpouſe His Majeſty's Cauſe no further than to be confirm'd, that he has been ill ſerv'd by ſome Perſons; and I am of Opinion, that he does not merit one Half of this ill Language at their Hands. Further, I dare ſay ſo much in his Behalf, by what has paſt already, that the <hi>Scots</hi> Crown will receive no Blemiſh or Diſreputation by his wearing of it; altho' he does not think it either ſit or juſt to Countenance an indirect Action of any of his Subjects.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45975:8"/>
                  <p>By the Beacons which your Author ſets up to ſcare him, to wit, of the Two <hi>Baliols</hi> of <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>William</hi> the Firſt; any Man without the Help of Spectacles may plainly perceive that he ſticks at nothing to advance his Cauſe, either by wreſting or perverting the Truth of the Hiſtory; by reaſon there can be no Parity in the Example, between the ſeveral Caſes of theſe dead Kings, whom he now brings on the Stage, and King <hi>William;</hi> nor is there any Colour of Alluſion to introduce them here for Scare-crows. For the Truth of the Story runs thus: After the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, Ten or a Dozen far-fetched Relations of the Royal Family ſtanding Competitors for the <hi>Scots</hi> Crown, it was agreed on by the different Parties (to prevent the Effuſion of Blood) that the Trial of their ſeveral Claims ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt of <hi>England. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> accepting the Office came to <hi>Berwick,</hi> then a <hi>Scots</hi> Town, where, after a long time ſpent in canvaſſing the ſeveral Titles, he found <hi>Bruce, Baliol,</hi> and <hi>Cummin</hi> ſtand faireſt for it. To make a long Tale ſhort, he now found it in his Power to accompliſh that which his Predeceſſors ſtruggl'd for, for ſome Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years before, to wit, a Submiſſion of the <hi>Scots</hi> Crown to that of <hi>England.</hi> He felt <hi>Bruce</hi>'s Pulſe, but it did not beat to his Mind; then he ſounded <hi>Baliol,</hi> who had more <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood in him by half than <hi>Scotch,</hi> who eaſily
<pb facs="tcp:45975:8"/>condeſcended to his Terms. <hi>Edward</hi> declares <hi>John Baliol,</hi> King of the <hi>Scots;</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility having ſwore Allegiance to him in his Preſence, proceeded to his Coronation. That being over, the new <hi>Scots</hi> King, with his Nobility, came to King <hi>Edward,</hi> to thank him for his Civility at <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſplendidly regaled for ſome time, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> King being to ſet out for <hi>London, John Baliol,</hi> with his Train of Nobles, came in a full Body to kiſs his Royal Fiſt; where on a ſuddain, King <hi>Baliol</hi> claps down on his Knee, and ſwore Fealty to <hi>Edward</hi> as his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord, and to hold the <hi>Scots</hi> Crown for ever, of him and his Succeſſors, Kings of <hi>England. Baliol</hi> having ended this Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, pointed to his Subjects to follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; which being needleſs to diſpute on that Ground, no Body ſtumbl'd at it, ſave a peeviſh Old Gentleman, by Name <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> who was Caged up for the Remainder of his Life, for want of good Manners. <hi>Baliol</hi> and his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility march'd home to <hi>Scotland,</hi> as chearfully as Half a Dozen Citizens Wives return to their Husbands, after they have been decoy'd into a Ramble, and kiſs'd by ſtrange Fellows; and they being all alike Scabby, made no Words on't for ſome Years, and, perhaps, had not then, if a raſh Sentence had not been paſs'd by <hi>Baliol</hi> in his own Court, in Prejudice of a certain Thane or Earl; who thinking himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:45975:9"/>injur'd, appeal'd to <hi>Edward</hi> as Sovereign Lord: King <hi>Edward</hi> being willing to ſhow his Grandeur, ſummon'd <hi>Baliol</hi> up to <hi>London,</hi> and being ſeated on a Throne in his Court of Judicature, his Fellow King had the Honour to ſet by him, till ſuch time as the Tryal came on, and then he was oblig'd to ſtep down to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Bar, and Plead for himſelf. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had got ſo much <hi>Scotch</hi> Blood in him, by his Three Years Government of that Kingdom, that he ſtomach'd the Diſgrace, and could not tell how to digeſt it, till he went Home and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted his Nobility, who were all alike tardy with himſelf: It was ſoon agreed on, to bid <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Defiance, declaring, That their King and they were only trick'd into their Submiſſion by his foul Artifice. Both Nations Arm'd, but <hi>Edward</hi> got the Better on't; for having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run <hi>Scotland,</hi> and made them once or twice ſwear heartily anew; and having caught <hi>John Baliol</hi> by the Neck, would never afterwards truſt him with ſuch an Office; but kept him Priſoner at <hi>London</hi> for many Years, till at the Interceſſion of the Pope and <hi>French</hi> King, his Impriſonment was enlarg'd to <hi>France,</hi> where he died a <hi>Quondam</hi> King.</p>
                  <p>Now, whether this Fate of <hi>John Baliol</hi> has any Relation to what your Author deſigns (ſince 'tis plain, that <hi>Edward</hi> both made and unmade him, and not the <hi>Scots)</hi> I refer it back to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:45975:9"/>to reconcile. As for the other <hi>Baliol,</hi> by Name <hi>Edward,</hi> and Son to this <hi>John,</hi> he finding that <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> was the Second time dead, came from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>England;</hi> and, there having <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's Leave to raiſe what Men he could, to ſeat himſelf on his Father's Old Throne, found Voluntiers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (who were the Relations of thoſe who were foil'd at <hi>Bannocksburn)</hi> and with thoſe, and a few of King <hi>Edward's</hi> Ships, he lands in the Heart of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſet young <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Bruce</hi>'s Crown on his own Head, without asking the <hi>Scots</hi> Leave; and kept it till <hi>D<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> with the Aſſiſtance of his Father-in-Law the <hi>French</hi> King, took it from him again. Neither can I ſee the Paralel in this with King <hi>William</hi>'s Caſe; for <hi>Edward Baliol</hi> took the Crown at his own Hand <hi>nolens volens,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as King <hi>William</hi> had it preſs'd upon his Head by the unanimous Conſent of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation. As for the other Two Examples of <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> the First, what they did while it was their Misfortune to be Priſoners in <hi>England,</hi> could not ſtand in Law; neither did I ever hear, that after their Freedom, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration to their Dignities, their <hi>Scots</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects did ever reckon it to them for Sin.</p>
                  <p>But as there's no great Advantage or Credit to be purchaſed, by ripping up ſuch old Sores, ſo I am willing to leave tracing this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
<pb facs="tcp:45975:10"/>Evidences, and rather take Things on his own Authority, than foul Paper about it. Mean while, I'll be as impertinent as he is with his Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and ſome others, and acquaint you with ſomething that may be nearer the Caſe. It has been obſerv'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Courſe of ſeveral Ages, that it hath been ever fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to Families when they became ſo powerful as to ſwell beyond their Proportion: Witneſs that of the <hi>Cummins,</hi> in <hi>Robert Bruce</hi>'s Reign, the greateſt that ever has been in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that of the <hi>Gouries,</hi> of a latter Date: And if I ſhould add that of a latter Family, within the Reach of our Memory, which might have reaſonably been reckon'd in the ſame Claſs, had it not been for the happy Accident of the Revolution, I cannot be far miſtaken. I ſay, moſt of theſe Gentlemen being too great for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, loſt themſelves with <hi>Jearus</hi> in their Flight: Some got red-hot Iron Crowns, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Halters; but that which was more Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical, their whole Families and Dependants were hung up like Haddocks to dry in the Sun, that they might never afterwards riſe in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I heartily wiſh there may no ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples happen in our Age; and that no ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons ſit ſo cloſe to the Machine of your Colony, nor wind up its Spring further than it will go, leaſt it ſhould ſnap, and the Ingineers get o'er the Fingers End.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45975:10"/>
                  <p>Being ſenſible that I have treſpaſs'd in the Epidemical Crime of my Fellow-Scribblers, by ſwelling my Dedication beyond its Proportion, and, perhaps, ſaid more than ſome Perſons care to hear; I'll proceed to the Reaſons, why the Gentlemen of the Colony have dropt off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; praying, that the ſame may ſerve, if it be true, that the whole Body has follow'd their Example; as likewiſe, that you mayn't hang thoſe Two poor innocent Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomry</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jollie,</hi> late Councellors of your Colony, whom you have been pleas'd to find Guilty of a Deſign, to deſert <hi>Caledonia,</hi> and run away with one of your Frigats.

                  <p>PREJUDICE being apt to byaſs a Man's Pen, the Pur-blind Pillars of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company will not ſtick to taint me with it. That I mayn't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, I don't profeſs my ſelf their Friend, having the ſame Reaſon, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more, as thoſe Skelletons who have narrowly eſcap'd the Kingdom of Heaven, and are ſtarv'd to Death. Nevertheleſs, I declare, that I will curb my Sentiments ſo far, as to keep my ſelf cloſe to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, giving an impartial Account
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45975:12"/>of the Procedure of that Company, and of the indirect Artifices they made uſe of, to decoy a great many honeſt Gentlemen, and other brave Fellows into their Service, and how they left them in the Lurtch, expos'd to Famine, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mines: And if I deviate in any particular Paſſage from the Truth, I lay my ſelf fairly open to the fierceſt Steel'd Pen of the Company, who, no doubt, will endeavour to vindicate them, and ſtifle my Credit. All the Favour I ask, is, that they give me fair Play, ſtick cloſe to the Subject, and bring better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for what they write, than what the Author of the Colony's Defence hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, to diſprove the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Title to the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien,</hi> and to advance that of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Paterſon,</hi> the Author of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and Penman (as it it is ſhrewdly gueſs'd) of the <hi>Octroy,</hi> came from <hi>Scotland</hi> in his younger Years, with a Pack on his Back, whereof the Print may be ſeen, if he be alive; having travell'd this Country ſome Years, he ſeated himſelf under the Wing of a warm Widow, near <hi>Oxford;</hi> where finding that Preaching was an eaſier Trade than his own, ſoon found himſelf gifted with an <hi>Anadab</hi>'s Spirit. Prophets being generally deſpis'd at Home, he went on the <hi>Propoganda ſide.</hi> Account to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45975:12"/>and was one of thoſe who ſettled the Iſland of <hi>Providence</hi> a Second time: But meeting ſome Hardſhips, and ill Luck there, to wit, a Governour being impos'd on them by the King of <hi>England,</hi> which his Conſcience could not admit of, the Property of their Conſtitutions was alter'd, and they could no longer a Free Port, or Sanctuary for Buccaneers, Pyrates, and ſuch Vermin, who had moſt need of being reclaim'd into the Church: This Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment oblig'd <hi>Praedicant Paterſon</hi> to ſhake the Duſt from off his Shooes, and leave that Iſland under his <hi>Anathema.</hi> He return'd to <hi>Europe</hi> ſome Twelve Years ago, with his Head full of Projects, having all the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements of Sir <hi>Henry Morgan, Batt Sharp,</hi> and the Buccaneers in his Budget: He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to make a Market of his Ware in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> but without any Succeſs: He went afterwards to <hi>Berlin,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd his Pack there, and had almoſt caught the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> in his Nooſe; but that miſcarry'd too: He likewiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the ſame Project to Mr. Secretary <hi>Blathwait,</hi> but ſtill with the ſame Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>Meeting thus with ſo many Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in theſe ſeveral Countries, he let his Project ſleep for ſome Years, and pitch'd his Tent at <hi>London,</hi> where Matter is never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to exerciſe plodding Heads. His former
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45975:13"/>Wife being at reſt as well as his Project, he wanted a Help that was meet for him, and not being very nice, went no further than the Red-fac'd Coffee-woman, a Widow in <hi>Burchin-Lane,</hi> whom he afterwards carry'd to the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Darien;</hi> and at her firſt landing thruſt her about Seven Foot under Ground, to make the Poſſeſſion <hi>de facto</hi> of <hi>New Caledonia</hi> more authentick. While he ſojourn'd in <hi>London,</hi> he found Employment for his Head; and like a true Quack, boggl'd at nothing that offer'd it ſelf to his Thought. He was concern'd in the <hi>Hampſtead</hi>-Water; and had an original Hand in the Project of the Bank of <hi>England;</hi> but being oblig'd (as he ſays himſelf) to communicate his Thoughts to ſome Eminent Men, who were more able to carry it on, they bubbl'd him out of the <hi>Premium,</hi> and the Glory of the Project. The Man thinking himſelf ill us'd by the Managers of the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> ſtudy'd how to be up with them; and in Oppoſition to it, he applies himſelf to the Project of the Orphans Bank, where he was afterwards ſometime a Director; but that miſſing of the Wiſh'd-for-Aim, by reaſon of the clipp'd Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he meeting with ſome Diſgrace there too, was reſolv'd at once to be even with the Body of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>Thus diſcontented, and uneaſie in his Mind, he rous'd up his <hi>Darien</hi> Genius, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45975:13"/>having vampt it up with ſome new Light he had purchas'd by converſing with <hi>Dampier,</hi> he marches Bag and Baggage to the Ancient Kingdom, where it met with ſuch Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement at firſt ſight, that <hi>Johnſton</hi>'s, or if you will <hi>Tweddale</hi>'s Act was <hi>viis &amp; modis,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and born in a Trice. At this time, and for ſome Months afterwards, <hi>Paterſon</hi> had more Reſpect paid him, than His Majeſty's High Commiſſioner; and happy was he or ſhe that had the Favour of a Quarter of an Hours Converſation with this bleſſed Man: When he appear'd in Publick, he look'd with a Head ſo full of Buſineſs and Care, as if he had <hi>Atlas</hi> his Burthen on his Back; and if a Man had a Fancy to be reputed Wiſe, the firſt Step he was to make, was to mimick <hi>Paterſon</hi>'s Fiz: Nay, ſome Perſons had ſuch a Conceit of the Miracles he could perform, that they began to talk of an Engine, to give the Iſland a half Turn-round, and to ſet the <hi>Orkneys</hi> where the Iſlands of <hi>Scilly</hi> ſtand.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed to the Cream of the Story, you are to underſtand, that Eſquire <hi>Paterſon</hi> (for at his Arrival in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he acquir'd or aſſum'd an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Title) brought a Couple of Tutors, or Nurſes along with him, who paſs'd for Partners in the Project, tho' in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Couple of ſubtle Youths, whoſe Office was to put <hi>Paterſon</hi>'s creud and indigeſted Notions into Form. One of theſe was a <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon</hi> by Birth, whoſe native Name was <hi>Le
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45975:14"/>Serrurier,</hi> and his <hi>Engliſh</hi> one <hi>James Smith.</hi> He was Maſter of moſt of the <hi>European</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and particularly of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> He formerly acted as Secretary to the fam'd <hi>Italian</hi> Prince, who put ſo many Tricks on the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> with his Philoſophers Stone; but at this Juncture he paſs'd for a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>London</hi> Merchant. The others Name was <hi>Daniel Lodge,</hi> born of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Parents in <hi>Leith,</hi> in <hi>Scotland, per</hi> Accident, bred a Merchant in <hi>Holland,</hi> but crack'd, and turn'd to his Shifts in <hi>England.</hi> This was a pleaſant, facetious Fellow, knew the World exactly, and acted his Part in this Tragi-Comedy to a Miracle.</p>
                  <p>So much I have offer'd by way of Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary, that you may have a Glimpſe of theſe dark Pillars, by which the <hi>Scotch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was to be lighted down into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>Darien</hi> Mines, and over that <hi>Iſthmus</hi> to the <hi>Phillipin</hi> Iſlands, <hi>California, China,</hi> and to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> it they could turn <hi>Dutch</hi> Men.</p>
                  <p>The Companies Act being now touch'd with the Royal Scepter, and for the more Diſpatch, paſs'd thro' the Seals <hi>per Saltum,</hi> they were empower'd by Virtue of a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Clauſe thereof, to take in Foreign Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions to a leſſer half of the Capital Stock; ſo that the main Streſs of the Project lay in fingering this Money. The Three Projectors frankly engag'd to uſe their Intereſt with their Correſpondents and Friends in <hi>England,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45975:14"/>Holland,</hi> and in the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns, for 300000 <hi>l</hi> at leaſt; in Conſideration of which, and of the Acquiſition, and in Token of their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for the Project, the Company was to give the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> 20000 <hi>l</hi> So to work all Hands went.</p>
                  <p>There being three different Parties in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> jarring at that Time, about the <hi>India</hi> Trade, and the Old Company having got the Better on't, it was eaſie to draw a great many of the Male-Contents into the <hi>Scotch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Net; nay, the Subſcriptions came in ſo quick that he was the happieſt Man that could get his Name firſt down in their Books: For <hi>Paterſon</hi> preach'd up only an <hi>India</hi> Trade here in <hi>England,</hi> taking no Notice of <hi>Darien,</hi> but to ſome Select Heads that were able to bear it; when once the Mony was in <hi>Scotl.</hi> they knew how to diſpoſe of it. To be ſhort, they had now more Money in their View than they knew what to do withal, if the Houſe of Commons had not baulk'd them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primanded the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> for their Foolery. The Companies Books were cary'd Home with abundance of Secrecy and Care, tho' they had as good left them behind, there having been never a Groat of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney paid in as yet. The Projectors follow'd them as the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> did the Ark in old Times; and when they came to <hi>Scotland,</hi> their chief Buſineſs was to preach up the vaſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which the Houſe of Commons fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45975:15"/>to acreu to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. by this <hi>Octroy</hi> and Trade, and to back their Sermons with the greater Authority, the Commons Addreſs to the King was printed and reprinted at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> (but not a Syllable of the King's Anſwer mention'd) which confirm'd the whole Country of the Riches they were like to be ſurfeited with by this Act and Trade. To be ſhort, they came in Shoals from all Corners of the Kingdom to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> Rich, Poor, Blind and Lame, to lodge their Subſcriptions in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's Houſe; and to have a Glimpſe of the Man <hi>Paterſon;</hi> who ſatisfy'd them as faſt as they came, that altho' they ſign'd ſuch a Sum for Faſhion's ſake, to give the Company more Reputation Abroad, yet the Quarter Part would only be demanded, there being no occaſion for any more; and that they could not lie out of the Uſe of their Money above 18 Months, or 2 Years at moſt, which by that time, and the Old Cant, of God's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, would fetch good Returns, and large Dividends.</p>
                  <p>The Companies Books had not been long open'd in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> before 400000 <hi>l</hi> was ſign'd (when it will be all paid in, the Lord of Hoſts knows) and it now being high time to ſhut the Books there, and go where the Money lay, to wit, the 300000 <hi>l</hi> in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns, the Projectors were conſulted about it. The Reſult of which was,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45975:15"/>that they might not act precipitately in this Affair, it was neceſſary they ſhould make ſome real Show of their Reſolution and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, by ſending a Couple of fit Perſons over to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> to build half a Dozen of ſtout Ships of 50 Guns apiece; that by laying out their Money in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Country, the <hi>Dutchmen</hi> might be prepoſſeſs'd with a kind Opinion of the Company, and thereby make it appear, how willing they were to extend the warm Rays of their <hi>Oct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi> to People who deſerv'd it better than their ungreatful Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>Some warm Debates happen'd on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſsion, what Two Perſons ſhould be entruſted with this mighty Affair, for by reaſon the Kirk and Church-money was equally in the Stock, both Parties endeavour'd to imploy their own Inſtruments. There were ſeveral Meetings on this Affair, and it was at long-run amicably concluded, that <hi>Alexander Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venſon,</hi> late Kirk-Treaſurer, or Kirk-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> a Zealous and Long-grace Sayer, and Capt. <hi>James Gibſon,</hi> Merchant and Malignant of <hi>Glaſco,</hi> ſhould be the Delegates.</p>
                  <p>The next material Thing that came in Courſe was to lodge a Stock of Caſh in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to anſwer their Delegates neceſſary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions abroad: The Sum agreed on was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 18 or 20000 <hi>l</hi> but what Man to entruſt with this Sum that was fed on <hi>Engliſh</hi> Beef and Puddin, was another Heſitation. The
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45975:16"/>Oracle <hi>Paterſon</hi> being conſulted herein ſage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſponded, that his Brother <hi>Smith</hi>'s Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs requiring him to go and remain for ſome time at <hi>London,</hi> he expecting ſome Ships home from <hi>Carolina</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> wherein he had large Effects; he was of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that they could not lodge it ſafer than in his Hands. <hi>Smith</hi> returns to <hi>London,</hi> and having got the Gelt in his Sack, never broke his Reſt afterwards about the Project. The Company at the ſame Time had ſubſtituted Two other Caſhiers abroad, to wit, Mr. <hi>Francis Stratford,</hi> Mechant, at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> (now Governour of that Company) and <hi>Alexander Henderſson,</hi> alias <hi>Archbiſshop,</hi> at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> who were to draw from <hi>Smith</hi>'s Bank, as the Delegates had Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Walloon</hi> Banker, and <hi>Italian</hi> Secretary anſwer'd the Bills punctually till a better half of the Money was extracted; about which Time finding the Company baulk'd of the <hi>Holland,</hi> as well as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he thought it neceſſary to hold his hand, and was paſſive in ſuffering a Bill of 200 <hi>l</hi> of <hi>Stratford</hi>'s drawn on him to be proteſted at <hi>London.</hi> I ſhall leave him here for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, that I may bring the reſt along with me, and only tell you, that <hi>Smith</hi> now find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf Maſter but of 8500 <hi>l</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Caſh, and not ſure that he ſhoulde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee ſo much of it again, and looking on this as little more than his <hi>Quota</hi> for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45975:16"/>and Subſcriptions (altho' the Latter hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to fail, not through any Fault or Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of him, but by the Frowns of the Houſe of Commons in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> by ſome ſurly <hi>Dutch</hi> Men Proprietors in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Companies, and Lords of <hi>Amſterdam</hi>) he thought the <hi>Premium</hi> wrought for ſufficiently, and that it was but juſt he ſhould pay himſelf, ſince his Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was as honeſt as if it had ſucceeded; and if he had anything over his neat Share, it was convenient to hold it faſt to enable him to go to Law the eaſier with the Company.</p>
                  <p>The Company bit their Lips, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to keep it huſh for ſome time, that the World might not perceive how they were deſervedly bubbl'd. <hi>Smith</hi> knowing their Circumſtances never went out of the Way for 15 or 16 Months afterwards; and then being ſenſible that if once the Compan. Ships were fail'd, there would be no great Occaſion to pay him any more Civilities to keep the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſecret, and conſequently he muſt expect the Company would be on his Back. On theſe Conſiderations he was on the Wing for his own Country, and was got ſo far on his Journey as <hi>Graveſend,</hi> when as Luck would had it, he was nabb'd with a <hi>Capio te</hi> at the Companies Inſtance. Some of his own and Wife's Relations were in the Coach with him, to ſee him to <hi>Dover,</hi> when this Accident happen'd: But he on this Occaſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd himſelf with more Sedateneſs of Mind, than M. <hi>Bouſfliers</hi> did at <hi>Namure;</hi> and being unwilling to part with the Money ſo dearly earn'd, beſpoke
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45975:17"/>Lodgings in the <hi>Marſhalſea,</hi> till on the late Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of that Sanctuary, the Marſhal and he went off together on a new Project to <hi>Carolina.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Daniel Lodge</hi> was at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> when the firſt Bill was proteſted, and had his Papers ſeiz'd and carry'd to the Campanies Office, and a Couple of Centries ſet over himſelf, but he being <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Blood, <hi>Scotch</hi> born, and <hi>Dutch</hi> bred, it was not eaſie to faſten any Thing on him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paterſon</hi> was at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> on the Embaſſie when he heard of the Misfortune of <hi>Stratford</hi>'s Bill; but all the Mends he could make, was to ſigh and look dull. Nevertheleſs it was obſervable, that altho' <hi>Paterſon</hi> rail'd at <hi>Smith</hi> behind his Back, there was never an ill Word between them when they met: For you are to underſtand, that <hi>Smith</hi> was one of the Companies Commiſſioners in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> about the Time he ſuffer'd the Bill to be proteſted in <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to return to the ſetting out of this Embaſſie; <hi>Stevenſon</hi> and <hi>Gibſon</hi> being for ſome time gone over the Water to build Ships, and beat the Way for Subſcriptions; the next Step was to chuſe fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to follow and manage this Point. Five ſuch were appointed by Name of the Committee of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Trade, who were cloath'd with an ample Commiſſion from the Company, to take Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Abroad, to appoint Factors, to controul the foreſaid Two Legates, to provide Officers and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and, in a Word, to do what they thought neceſſary for the Company's Service. <hi>Paterſon</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> were the firſt Two,—a <hi>Scotch</hi> Merchant of <hi>London</hi> the Third. The Laird of <hi>Gleneagles</hi> for the Church, and Colonel <hi>John Erskin,</hi> Governour of <hi>Sterling</hi>-Caſtle, and Darling of the Kirk, made up the <hi>Quorum,</hi> the laſt Two being both Men of Honour and Worth, but altogether Strangers to Trade.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:45975:17"/>
                  <p>Two of theſe were order'd to <hi>Holland</hi> directly from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Gleneagles</hi> was to paſs by <hi>London,</hi> where he was to do ſome buſineſs, and take <hi>Smith,</hi> and the other in his way. <hi>Gleneagles</hi> having ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>London,</hi> and joyn'd with the other two, articled with me at <hi>Moncreifs</hi> Coffee-houſe, in <hi>November,</hi> 1696. By the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Contract, I was to go in the Company's Service from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> or <hi>Hamburgh;</hi> from thence to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from thence on a Trading Voyage to either of the <hi>Indies,</hi> as the Company ſhould appoint; and thence back to <hi>Scotland.</hi> I was at the ſame time made tacitly to believe that I was to go to the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> and that the Ships would ſail next <hi>March</hi> at fartheſt. The Encouragement (if I had been candidly dealt with, and honeſtly paid) ſeem'd to be fair enough in Merchants Service: So having order'd my Affairs in <hi>England</hi> to go to <hi>India,</hi> I went in Company of theſe Gentlemen to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> following.</p>
                  <p>Here the whole Committee or Embaſſy met; where having view'd their Ships in that Port, to wit, one of 46 Guns ready built, and another of 60 on the Stocks they apply'd themſelves to the buſineſs of Subſcriptions. The Scheme laid down to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45975:18"/>them was this; <hi>Henderſon</hi> formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, a <hi>Scotch Man, Coſſart</hi> a <hi>French Man,</hi>—an <hi>Engliſh Man,</hi> and— a <hi>Ducth Man,</hi> all Merchants of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> were to ſubcribe 8500 <hi>l</hi> amongſt them (<hi>Smiths</hi> Summ) and were to draw in there Friends and Correſpondents for as much as they could: In conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, theſe four were to be the Company's Factors in <hi>Holland,</hi> and to have 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> for what they bought and ſold. This was eaſily agreed to; and for their further Encouragment, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted likewiſe with the 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all the Money already laid out by Capt. <hi>Gibſon</hi> on the two Ships, Canvas, Sails, Cables, Anchors, Powder, Guns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all above 10000 <hi>l</hi> which Properly was <hi>Gibſon</hi>'s right by his Commiſſion from the Company. This was the firſt honeſt ſtep they made by Vertue of their controuling Power.</p>
                  <p>Theſe new <hi>Dutch</hi> Factors ply'd their Friends all over <hi>Holland,</hi> who generally for ſome time before were mightily taken with the <hi>Scotch. Eaſt India, Trade,</hi> their Exemption from Duties for 21 years, and tickled with the Conceit that they ſhould be Sharers in it. But through an ugly accident which happen'd in <hi>Camphire,</hi> at <hi>Paterſon</hi>'s and the Collonels Landing, the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45975:18"/>whole Meſs of the Companies Pottage was in danger of being miſcook d. The Story runs thus: Theſe Gentlemen had a rough and tedious Paſſage from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and it ſeems the Skipper had not laid in Proviſions for his Paſſengers over plentifully, which was the occaſion that <hi>Paterſon</hi> at his landing in <hi>Camphire</hi> (and being welcom'd and entertain'd by one <hi>Panton,</hi> a Merchant there) taſted more freely of the Creature then he us'd to do; (for he always ſet up for a Water-biber) which <hi>Panton</hi> perceiving, ply'd him warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and took the Liberty of pumping him. <hi>Paterſon's</hi> Tongue running glib with the <hi>Hollands</hi> Cannal Water on the <hi>Eloginm's</hi> of the <hi>Octroy,</hi> happen'd to babble out a Secret of the Company, <hi>viz, That their Act empower'd them to give Commiſſions to any kind of People (without asking their Nation) to Trade to the</hi> Indies <hi>under</hi> Scots <hi>Colours; and that ſuch People might diſpoſe of their</hi> India <hi>Goods where they pleas'd, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding they made a ſham Entry in</hi> Scotland. And if the Company ſhould agree to take 3 <hi>per Cen.</hi> for the Goods, ſuch Ships as Traded with their Commiſſion were able to underſel the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> full 17 <hi>per Cent. Panton</hi> was glad of the News, &amp; improv'd the Story amongſt his Friends, who deſign'd to ſign in the Companies
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45975:19"/>Books; and theſe run now on this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for the 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> finding it a ſafer way of Trading, then by putting their Money in the Companies bottom; neither would they of <hi>Zealand</hi> ever afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on any other Terms.</p>
                  <p>We were no ſooner come to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> then we met with this Story freſh in the Coffee-houſes there. It was too late for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon</hi> to eat in his words; ſo that all the <hi>Salvo</hi> we could make to daſh the Story, was by ſaying, that this was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies ſho'el Anchor, if every thing elſe ſhould fail them; but that they had no occaſion to make uſe of that Power at preſent; nor that Mr. <hi>Paterſon</hi> meant ſo when he ſpoke it. But that which gave us the dead ſtroke in <hi>Holland,</hi> juſt as the Companies Books were open'd, the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt India</hi> Companies run open mouth'd to the Lords of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was hatching by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners in their City, to ruine the Trade of the United Provinces. The Lords gave them ſatisfaction in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and made no noiſe of it; for we were made to underſtand in a day or two afterwards, that our Subſcriptions were daſh'd, and none to be expected there. On this occaſion it was reſolved in the Commitee, that <hi>Paterſon,</hi> and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45975:19"/>ſhould forthwith proceed to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> to ſee what could be be done there, the reſt being to remain in <hi>Holland</hi> for ſome time, to give the leſs Umbrage to the <hi>Hamburgh</hi> Project.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hamburghers</hi> ſwallow'd the bait to a wiſh; for the more oppoſition the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> offer'd to the project, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd them the more that it was their Intereſt to embrace it. The River <hi>Elve,</hi> on which <hi>Hamburgh</hi> ſtands, is Navigable for flat bottom Barges of 70 or 80 Tuns, for ſome 200. Miles up into the Country of <hi>Germany,</hi> which gives them an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſerving all the <hi>North</hi> parts of that <hi>Empire</hi> with Goods more convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then the <hi>Hollanders</hi> can: And as they have no <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Goods but what they have at ſecond hand from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> or a few from <hi>Denmark,</hi> by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company, they have a proſpect of worming the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> out of a good part of the <hi>German</hi> Trade.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Parentheſi</hi> I muſt own that this part of the Project was Reaſonable on both the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Hamburgher</hi> ſide, if it had been meant as it was told; but the Devil on't was, the <hi>Hamburgers</hi> knew nothing of <hi>Darien,</hi> but builded altogether on Ships laden with <hi>India</hi> Goods, whereof their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45975:20"/>City and Port was to be the Receptacle and Mart; while <hi>Paterſon</hi> wanted only their Money to raiſe Forces to over-run <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The way being thus prepared by theſe two Fore-runers, the body of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitee receiv'd advice to repair thither at ſight, all things being ready for Signing and Sealing. And I receiving orders to accompany them, ſet out from <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> after we had ſpent three Mouths there in vain; and arrived at <hi>Humburgh</hi> on <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-day,</hi> 1697. Our Affair was ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally favour'd by the Burghers of this City, that at our arrival we printed <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caarts,</hi> and fix'd them on the Exchange, and other publick Places there, intimating that the Companies Books were to be open'd in the <hi>Commercie Kamber</hi> the week following for Subſcriptions; but they were to take notice (the beſt Jeſt on't) <hi>That by the Conſtitutions of the Company, no Man could ſign above</hi> 3000 l. <hi>ſterling for himſelf; as likewiſe, that their Books could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit above</hi> 200000 l. <hi>in all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Placaarts</hi> were no ſooner paſted up on the Poſts, than Pamphlets were crying up and down the Streets, full of ill Nature, and a great many ſad Truths; adviſing the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> to enquire fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Project, before they parted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45975:20"/>with their Money, leſt they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee it again. Theſe Pamphlets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd 3 or 4 Sheets, and were printed in <hi>French, High</hi> and <hi>Low Dutch,</hi> under the Title of, <hi>A Letter from a Friend in</hi> Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>to his Friend in</hi> Hamburgh. But the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> having ſuch a Confidence in <hi>Paterſon</hi>'s Phiz, and ſmooth Tongue, and by the forward appearance the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany made with their new Ships of 50 Guns all in a row, they believ'd all this ſtuff, to be hatch'd in <hi>Samaria,</hi> from whence no good can be expected.</p>
                  <p>But that the Scriptures might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd, <hi>by the Elects meeting with Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Croſſes while they ſojourn here;</hi> or on the other hand, <hi>that of Honeſty's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt Policy,</hi> either you pleaſe; the Companies Book was likewiſe ſhut up here, without getting a Groat of the <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers</hi> Money, although that City got near 30000 <hi>l</hi> of the Company's. The human reaſon of this Diſappointment, if I am not miſtaken, was as follows; in the <hi>Octroy</hi> there was a certain unneceſſary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, which occaſion'd a great many <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollands</hi> Speculations, <hi>viz. That in caſe the Company ſhould be interrupted in their Trade,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the King had ingag'd to interpoſe the Regal Authority to do them Right, and that at the publick Charge. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon,</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:45975:21"/>and the other Agents of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to magnifie their Charter, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate in all Companies, <hi>That the King was to aſſiſt and defend them with his Ships of War, or otherwiſe, if there was occaſion, and that out of his own Pocket, which they did not queſtion to be Engliſh Coin;</hi> when at the ſame time, the words of the Act cannot bear it; much leſs, That a <hi>Scots</hi> Act of Parliament ſhould diſpoſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships and Money. But ſince the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company would force this gloſs on the Text for their Advantage, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to <hi>India</hi> made as profitable a uſe of it the other way; for ſay they, Was it not enough that the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> ſhould paſs an Act in favour of his <hi>Scots</hi> Subjects to Trade to <hi>India,</hi> and exempt them from Duties for 21 years, which is an evitable Prejudice to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, ſince it's impoſſible to hinder them from ſending their <hi>India</hi> Goods by ſtealth over the Border, and underſelling our Markets by 25, or 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> but that they ſhould be empower'd to take in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners to be Sharers with them in this Trade; and not only thereby ſuck the Blood and Marrow out of <hi>England</hi> for 21 years, but that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships of War (for the maintenance of which great Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Impoſts are laid on our Trade and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45975:21"/>Goods) ſhould defend this <hi>Scotch</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's Trade, and theſe Foreigners who run away with the whole.</p>
                  <p>Theſe weak Proceedings of <hi>Paterſon</hi> and the other Agents, with the Sentiments the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had of it, made the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> ſend to the Senate of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> a Caution by Sir <hi>Paul Ricaut,</hi> Reſident there, to take care how they ſuffer'd their Burghers to embark with private Men, the King's Subjects, under the hopes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Protection, which being to the Prejudice of their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, could not be reaſonably expected. This was the Subſtance of the Memorial given in to that Senate, who had never hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto countenanc'd the Committee, altho' the Private Burghers were ſo Reſolute to Join.</p>
                  <p>Adverſe Fortune ſtill attending our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie, they thought fit to ſteer home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and make the beſt of a bad Market, being now fully ſatisfy'd that there's no other Body's Money to be Truſted to but their own: And having left me with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate <hi>Stevenſon</hi> to tend the Ships till farther Orders; they ſet out from <hi>Hamburgh</hi> in <hi>April.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Report of this Mournful Story be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made to the Board in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they found that they had been hatching rotten
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45975:22"/>Eggs for a Twelvemonth by-gone: But that which was ſtill worſe, 50000 <hi>l</hi> was ſunk into <hi>Dutchland</hi> on Ships that were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit for Merchants Service nor War, 8500 <hi>l</hi> ſunk in <hi>Smith</hi>'s Pocket, a Cargoe of all ſorts of Goods and Materials for a Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ready bought, <hi>viz. Scotch</hi> Cloath 8000 pieces White, <hi>ditto</hi> Brown 4 or 5000. <hi>ditto</hi> died and ſtrip'd 2000. Sterling Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges 8000 Ells, Men and Womens Shoes 5 or 6000 pair, Slippers about 1500, pair, Mens coarſe Stockings 4000 pair, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens <hi>ditto</hi> 2000 pair, <hi>Scotch</hi> Hats a great quantity, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles 1500, Periwigs 4000. ſome Long, ſome Short, Campaigns, <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Bobs and Natural ones; and truly they were all Natural, for being made of <hi>Highlanders</hi> Hair, which is blanch'd, with the Rain and Sun, when they came to be open'd in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> they look'd like ſo many of <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Fireſhips that he ſent amongſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and could be of no uſe to the Colony, if it were not to mix with their Lime when they plaſter'd the Walls of their Houſes. This was all the Merchandable Cargoe, ſave about 500 <hi>l</hi> worth of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> Linen and <hi>Holland,</hi> and to the ſame value of little Trincums bought in <hi>Holland</hi> for a <hi>Guinea</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Trade, and about 2 or 3 Hogſheads of Bees-wax. The reſt was in Materials for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45975:22"/>the Colony, <hi>viz.</hi> Hoes, Axes, Matches, Knives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for the main Deſign 1500 ſpare Buccaneer-Pieces, ſome Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Barrels of Powder, Shot proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable and about 80 or 90 Drums. This Cargoe of Merchandize and Materials for the Colony, amounted to about 19000 <hi>l</hi> including 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> advance, which the Company charg'd on every Article. So that there was about 74000 of the 100000 <hi>l</hi> Sunk. The remainder was towards Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, Payment of the Sailors and other Servants of the Company, and Diſcharge of the Company's Civil Liſt: But of this odd Money above 10000 <hi>l</hi> was deficient in the Payments, to wit, ſome great Men could not be forc'd to pay, they Natively thinking their Countenance to the thing to be enough for their ſhare; others were Sick, and a great many ſtark Dead of the Project, but moſt of them not able to raiſe their <hi>Quota.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Company's Affairs looking now ſo pale-fac'd, they were for ſome time ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Reſolutions: And on this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it was propos'd to the Board by the Laird of <hi>Drummellier,</hi> a Topping and Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man of the Company, and back'd by <hi>Robert Watſon,</hi> a Leading Man amongſt the Merchant Directors, that they ſhould ſend Order to their Agents in <hi>Holland</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45975:23"/>
                     <hi>Hamburgh</hi> to ſell off the Ships, and that their Committee of homeward Improvements ſhould diſpoſe of the foreſaid Cargoe to the beſt Advantage, and the Company to make a Dividend of the Product, amongſt the Proprietors of the Stock. This Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal was Rejected as Inglorious, and they being now <hi>in utrumque Parati,</hi> were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd <hi>Seu varſare dolos,</hi> and that their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but not themſelves, ſhould be the Victims to the <hi>Certae occumbere Morti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this Minute they fixt their Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ſince their Ships were built, the Proviſions, Cargoe, and other Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries already provided, they ſhould not look back, but equip for Sea with all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; if they Periſh there, or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Miſcarry, they could ſhew the World that they drove the Nail ſo far as it would go, and at laſt, ſhift the Miſcarriage from off themſelves. And to ſatisfie the World that their Deſpair was evident; at the ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Company's laſt Inſtructions to the Colony, This <hi>Drummellier</hi> would have it added in the Poſtſcript as a Benediction, That they ſhould get Money Honeſtly if they could, but be ſure to get it, and if they came Home without it, then the Devil get them all.</p>
                  <p>By the ſequel of the Story the Reader
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45975:23"/>may judge whether they did not put this Reſolution into Practice. After the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie or Committee of Foreign Trade left <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> nothing Remarkable paſt there, ſave that after Mr. <hi>Stratford</hi> had given them a Splendid Entertainment for their Foy, they went off without bidding him kiſs there—and believing that all theſe Diſhes were a Pig of their own Sow, left Inſtructions behind them that he ſhould not act any longer as the Company's Caſhier. Whether this was the True Reaſon of his being laid aſide, or that of his Original Sin, I cannot reſolve you; but this I know, that he gave them Credit at their firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> indented with the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the four Ships, with the Ropemakers, Blackſmiths, and other Artificers, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Company, and bound himſelf for performance of the ſeveral Contracts; and at laſt he was oblig'd to Arreſt the ſame Ships (as they were ſitting out) for 800 <hi>l</hi> Flemiſh, that being the Ballance of his Accompts; and they lay in <hi>Limbo</hi> a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night or three Weeks before this Money could be paid.</p>
                  <p>We Sail'd with two of theſe Ships, <hi>viz,</hi> the <hi>Caledonia</hi> and St. <hi>Andrew</hi> from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> the 10 of <hi>November,</hi> 1697. (having left the other two behind us, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Launch'd and lying to Rot in the Ouſe)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45975:24"/>and arriv'd in <hi>Leith</hi> Road on the 20th. to the no ſmall Joy of the Proprietors of the Stock, two Thirds of whom firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd for ſix Months by-gone that all was Cheat, and that there was no ſuch Ships in <hi>Rerum Natura.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the ſame time the <hi>Riſing-Sun</hi> of 60 Guns, and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi> of 46, were fallen down from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to the <hi>Texel,</hi> in order to joyn us, that we might make our Parade the more Splendid in <hi>Leith</hi> Road. Theſe Ships, you muſt know, had their Complement of Men bore on them for ſeveral Months before, as if they had been ready to Sail; but Archbiſhop <hi>Henderſon,</hi> their truſty Friend and Agent, having about 3000 <hi>l</hi> due to him and Partners, did not think it diſcreet to let both Ships go till he had the Money in his Pocket; ſeveral kind Epiſtles and civil Words paſt between the Company and him on this occaſion, but to no material purpoſe; for he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that if once they got the Ships in <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Money might be like Butter in the Black Dog's Hauce, or that they might detain ſo much of it as came to the <hi>Quota</hi> of his and Partners Subſcriptions, which he and they had no Inclination to. On theſe Conſiderations the Archbiſhop ſent home the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn,</hi> and brought the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's <hi>Riſing-Sun</hi> back to the <hi>Meridian</hi> of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45975:24"/>
                     <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where ſhe being Frozen up, for that Seaſon, was oblig'd to lie till ſhe Thaw'd, and for ſome Months afterwards, till he had his Dutch <hi>Gilt</hi> again. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I think the Accident was very lucky, for beſides the Honour which the Company purchas'd by entertaining the Czar of <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi> Aboard while ſhe lay at the Pales of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> if ſhe had gone to the <hi>West-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> ſhe might have ſet there and never ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen again; and ſo <hi>Drummellier</hi> would have been diſappointed of his Dividend.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hamburgher</hi> Ships and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn,</hi> being arriv'd at <hi>Leith,</hi> it was reſolv'd to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them up the <hi>Fryth</hi> till the hardeſt of the Winter was over; but the Seamen (a great part of whom had been 11 or 12 Months in the Service, and as void of Faith as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) would not move an inch till they were paid, altho' ſeveral of the Directors came Aboard to Interpoſe their Authority. This oblig'd a certain Committee to be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their Payment, who brought down the Money to <hi>Leith,</hi> and endeavouring to ſhow themſelves Good Husbands for the Company, pinch'd may be 5, 6 or 7 Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings out of each Man's Wages, (not for Dammages, for there was no Goods) which oblig'd the Sailors to give them a hearty Curſe to their Faces, ſo ſoon as they had got the Money in their Hats. All that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45975:25"/>was ſav'd in the <hi>Caledonia</hi> by this Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was within 40 <hi>l</hi> And when I told Little <hi>Blackwood</hi> my Sentiments of it at the Pay-Table, he reply'd, that it was no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, every Little makes a Mickle, and the Company had need to ſave all they can. The Conſequence of this was, that when the Company had occaſion to fit out their Ships in the Spring, none of theſe Sailors that were worth the hanging, would Liſt themſelves, and we were oblig'd to take Tag, Rag and Bobtail, and ſuch as no Skipper in the <hi>Fryth</hi> would Eatertain. The Company indeed depended on their Country-Men who were diſcharg'd of the Engliſh Service on the Peace, but they were diſappointed, for none of them would leave Old <hi>England.</hi> So that when we came to Sea, we were ſo feebly Mann'd, (altho' we had Eaters enough) that if it had not been for the Land Officers and their Men, I am ſatisfy'd that our Ships had run away with us.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>July</hi> following, the Ships being ready to Sail, the Sea-men were paid off, and for their farther Encouragement, receiv'd 2 Months Pay Advance; as for the reſt, thoſe who are alive, muſt catch it if they can, tho' it may be gueſs'd what they have to truſt to, by the Defences which the Company makes at this time in <hi>Doctors-Commons,</hi> in an
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45975:25"/>Action of Sea Wages they are ſued for. To wit, that the Company Transfer'd their Ships, Men and Cargo, over to the Collonie; that they are now two diſtinct Societies, that what Wages were due by the Company, were paid before the Ships went from <hi>Scotland;</hi> and altho' the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany advanc'd the foreſaid two Months Pay, yet it was not on their own account, but lent to the Collonie. This is a pretty ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Evaſion of the Company to cheat ſo many poor Men out of their Wages: I don't know what ſucceſs ſuch Defences will meet with in their own Courts, but they are now rejected in <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> and the Money order'd to be brought into the Court.</p>
                  <p>But before I go any further, I'll give you a clearer View of this Transfer. The Company having laid out a round Summ of Money on this Expedition, thought the moſt probable way of ſeeing it again, was to charge the Collonie with it, to let them improve it the beſt way they could, and pay the Company certain Parcels of it at ſuch and ſuch Terms. They valu'd theſe three Ships and Cargo, with the two Tenders, (including the Proviſions and Mens Wages they had already paid) at 70000 <hi>l</hi> for which they took the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Bond to be paid as aforeſaid. They
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45975:26"/>were likewiſe to have certain ſhares in the Mines, Minerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to be free of Duties in the <hi>Collonies</hi> Ports, whereas Strangers were to pay 2 <hi>per Cent.</hi> (which was to be apply'd to the maintenance of the Collonies Forts, and other neceſſary Uſes.) Theſe Gentlemen, who gave their joynt Bond for this 70000 <hi>l</hi> were not worth ſo many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pence; and the Tranſfer was ſo clandeſtinely carried on, that if it had been known to the Sea-men, or thoſe who expected Wages, there had not one Soul of them gone in the Service. And I dare be poſitive, that when we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd in <hi>Darien,</hi> this Transfer was ſuch a ſecret, that it was not known to ten Men beſides the Councellors.</p>
                  <p>The Seamen being thus paid by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany what was due to them, with the two Months advance, were made believe that when once theſe Landmen were ſet aſhore, they were to proceed on <hi>a</hi> Trading Voyage, and return to <hi>Scotland</hi> to be paid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were well enough ſatisfy'd. The Landmen were ſtill in worſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for they had no Pay, nor none to truſt to; only the hopes they were faten'd with of picking the Gold off the Leaves of the Trees, which few of them doubted of, that went on that foot. For the more formality of the thing, and to make it of a greater value,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45975:26"/>there was a kind of Indenture or Contract between the Company and theſe Landmen. The Soldiers were not to go under that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, but that of Planters. The 60 Officers (12 of them had been Captains in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the other 48 ſubalterns) were term'd Over-ſeers, Sub-Overſeers and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. The true Myſtery of their cramp Names lay here, if I am not miſtaken: The <hi>Octroy</hi> empower'd the Company to liſt and entertain Soldiers for the Service of their Collonies, and to exerciſe Martial Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; but at the ſame time, what Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they liſted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> muſt be with the Privy Councils leave firſt obtain'd. At the liſting and enrolling of theſe Land-men, the Company thought it in vain to ask the Council that ſavour, for ſome weighty Reaſons, which I ſhall not offer here; ſo took their own way of Chriſt'ning them, deſigning at the ſame time to make them anſwer the ſame ends, when once they got them between the <hi>Tropicks;</hi> and in the mean time, it was not neceſſary that theſe Land Officers, or Planting Soldiers ſhould know the ſecret of their Infirmity. I muſt tell you, that <hi>Pennycook,</hi> and ſome more of the Council were ſo ignorant of it, that if it had not been for one who was none of their Number, they had hang'd up ſome of the Land-men at Sea, to try their hand.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45975:27"/>And after we had been a while in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and the poor Men ſo ſtarv'd, that they were oblig'd to deſert to any body that could fill their Bellies, ſome 9 or 10 of theſe were brought back by a party; and ſince they found they could not hang them, without running the hazard of being hang'd themſelves for it afterwards, they chain'd great Weights of Iron to their Leggs, and condemn'd them for a certain number of years to Slavery. Theſe Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were as unlegal as the other; for if by the Conſtitutions of the Collony their Port be free, and if theſe Men be Planters by the Indenture or Contract made with the Company, they are Freemen, and not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the laſh of Martial Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>The Terms of theſe Indentures run thus, <hi>That the Planters ſhould be mantain'd by the Company three Years; and what Ground they clear'd in that time, ſhould be diſpos'd of by the Colony, as they ſhould think fit; allowing</hi> 50 <hi>Acres to each Planter, with a Houſe in the Capital City of</hi> 50 <hi>foot ſquare;</hi> 100 <hi>Acres to each Officer, with a Houſe proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable.</hi> And to ſet the greater value on that rich land, the Councellors themſelves, by the Conſtitutions, could not have above three Portions, to wit, 150 Acres. Theſe poor deluded Fellows had better ſold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the time in ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:45975:27"/>or <hi>French</hi> Plantations, and have got 18 or 20 <hi>l</hi> by the bargain, without either running the hazard of ſtarving, or of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mines. And altho' there had been no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of either, yet what could a naked man make of this 50 Acres of Ground, or of 500, at the three years end, if it were not to ſow Potatoes, Maez, and Plantains, and live as <hi>Adam</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>This is all the Encouragement theſe Gentlemen and Planters had to truſt to; and altho' moſt, or all the Officers had been liſted 4 or 5 Months before they were ſhip'd aboard, yet they had not a farthing allow'd them for their ſubſiſtance, but what the 12 Captains or Overſeers could pinch out of their Companies; neither could that be much, for their Planters were allow'd but 3 <hi>d.</hi> a day for their ſubſiſtance, from the date of their liſting, to their going on board; indeed about a Month before we ſail'd, upon a certain occaſion of the Land Officers grumbling, the Directors, out of their Benevolence, or rather to ſtop their Mouths, order'd 10 <hi>l</hi> for each Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with a Subſcription of 100 <hi>l</hi> in the Capital Stock (which was only 25 <hi>l</hi> Gift,) and for the Subalterns in Proportion; which generous Gratuity made all things eaſie.</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:45975:28"/>
                  <p>The Contract or Charter Party between the Company and Council, was penn'd before the Councellors were created; but that ſignify'd little, for theſe Candidates would ſcarce have ſtuck at the Terms, tho' they had been harder. But to tell you the truth, they were to ſeek for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons fit for that purpoſe, and were glad to take ſuch as they could get. By the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions a greed on by <hi>Rozy Mackenzie,</hi> and the Company, ſeven Councellors were to be created before the Ships ſail'd from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and theſe were to be inveſted with a Power to aſſume to the number of ſix more, as they ſhould ſee occaſion. I have reaſon to believe that the deſign of leaving theſe ſix Chairs vacant, was for the Encouragement of ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Men of Subſtance, as ſhould come in and joyn them from the <hi>Weſt India</hi> Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>To give you the Characters at large of theſe 7 Councellors, would be tedious; wherefore I deſire you may accept of this in ſhort. 1. James Cunningham <hi>led the Van, he had been a Major in the</hi> Scots <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and disbanded on the Peace; a Pillar of the Kirk, and never out of</hi> Scotland <hi>before.</hi> 2. Donald Macay, <hi>a Scrivener's or Writer's Clerk, newly come out of his Apprenticeſhip, but a Youth of good Parts.</hi> 3. — Veach, <hi>a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45975:28"/>Man of no Trade, but advanc'd to this Poſt on the account his Father was a godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and a Glorifier of God, I think in the Graſs-market.</hi> 4. Robert Jollie, <hi>a jolly</hi> Scotch <hi>over-grown</hi> Hamburger, <hi>who was ormerly a Skipper, and us'd the</hi> Shetland <hi>Trade, but had for ſome dozen years been ſet up at</hi> Hamburgh, <hi>in quality of Merchant; and after that a Broker, and now a Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</hi> 5. Robert Pennycook, <hi>formerly a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in the Engliſh Navy, then a Lieutenant, and afterwards Commander of a Bomb; this Gentleman having gain'd Experience by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 21 <hi>years from</hi> Scotland <hi>in ſeveral Trades or Occupations, he was by a Stratagem of an Acquaintance of mine, call'd home to take this Poſt upon him, about 6 or 7 Weeks before we ſail'd, and was advanc'd by the Intereſt of the Krak Party, the better to ballance that of the Church, and to keep our Dr.</hi> M— <hi>a reputed Atheiſt, who would certainly have debauch'd both. Mr.</hi> Pennycook <hi>was not only Councellor, but likewiſe Captain, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madore, and the very</hi> Orford <hi>of our Navy.</hi> 6. James Montgomrie, <hi>whoſe Deſignation I cannot well tell, but you may know him by the Story of the bloody Fight he had with the</hi> Spaniard, <hi>where ſo many hundred were kill'd and taken Priſoners, tho' at the ſame time there was never a</hi> Spaniard <hi>hurt. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was formerly an Enſign in the</hi> Scots
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45975:29"/>
                     <hi>Guards, but not liking that Office, left it, and carry'd a brown Musket in another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment. The Reaſons of his Preferment to this Poſt, was his Grand-fathers being Earl of</hi> Eglington; <hi>and his own Father, by the Mothers ſide, being Major General</hi> Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomrie. 7. Robert Pincarton, <hi>a good down right, rough ſpun Tar, never known before by any Deſignation or State Office, ſave that of Boatſwain to Sir</hi> William Phipps, <hi>when he was on the</hi> Wreck; <hi>and now, poor fello<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe were the ſeven wiſe Men, who were to divide <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> amongſt them. <hi>Veach</hi> being ſick of the Voyage, ſtay'd at home; and on this occaſion <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Paterſon,</hi> whom I hinted at before, having come from <hi>Scotland</hi> with us in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Voluntier (for he was in Diſgrace ſome Months before we came off; and his projecting Head growing too big to get out of the Ports of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> without an Engine, he was at his liberty either to go into the <hi>Tolbooth,</hi> or on board in this Station, which he pleas'd) was aſſum'd into the Senate in <hi>Veach</hi>'s Place, after we had got ſo far as the <hi>Madera's</hi> on our Voyage.</p>
                  <p>I had almoſt forgot to tell you of our Clergy, with whom I ought, in good
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45975:29"/>Manners, to have begun. Two Miniſters with a Journey-Man to take up the Pſalm, were commiſſion'd by the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, with full Inſtructions, I ſuppoſe, to diſpoſe of the Bibles among the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> One of theſe was an Extraordinary good Man, but he ow'd his Education to the Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where the Kirk Ruſt was rubb'd off him. The other was Young Headſtrong, as infallible as his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Sawcy and as Impertinent as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator himſelf. They thought to have eſtabliſht the <hi>Scotch</hi> Kirk Diſcipline in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> but having paſt the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> they could find ſuch a ſenſible Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in our Men, nay, in the <hi>Major</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by the Influence of that Zone, that they began to diſpair of it, and their Heart-ſtrings being quite broke at the Sight of that dear Land of Promiſe, they juſt lookt upon it and ſo were gather'd to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. They were not much miſs't indeed; for the only Time we had Oceaſion for the Prieſtly Office, was the Marriage of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon</hi>'s Wifes Maid, after her Belly had been a Third up, and then her Maſter happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be <hi>Praeſes,</hi> or high Prieſt for the Week, Celebrated it in as much Form, or perhaps more than if it had been done in a <hi>Scotch</hi> Kirk.</p>

                  <p>But before I leave <hi>Europe</hi> altogether; I muſt tell you One Paſſage more, which was a Secret to a great Part of the Court of Directors when we left <hi>Scotland,</hi> it being manag'd only by the private Committee, and 2 or 3 more. The Story runs thus, The Companyes, or rather private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees Agents at <hi>London,</hi> had been for ſome time in Terms with <hi>Lionel Wafer</hi> to bring him into the Service, they had no poſitive Inſtructions to agree with him at firſt, but only to ſound him as to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the Country of <hi>Darien. Wafer,</hi> it ſeems, was in Terms with ſome private Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> about ſending a Veſſel thither for <hi>Nicaragua</hi> Wood, to which he was to <hi>Pilot</hi> them; and about the ſame Time he was putting his Journals into the Preſs. <hi>Pennycook,</hi> before he left <hi>London,</hi> went with Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentleman and ſome others deſignedly to diſcourſe this <hi>Wafer,</hi> and having treated him at <hi>Pontacks,</hi> ſatisfy'd themſelves of his Capacity to ſerve the Company, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd him not to be haſty in Publiſhing his Book, or at leaſt till he heard further from <hi>Scotland.</hi> There was a Collection of ſome <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> amongſt theſe Gentlemen for <hi>Wafer,</hi> the better to back their Advice. When <hi>Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cook</hi> arriv'd in <hi>Scotland</hi> he acquainted the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45975:30"/>Committee with his Sentiments of <hi>Wafer,</hi> on which they wrote for Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> by the next Poſt to ſecure him for the Companies Service, and to make the eaſieſt Bargain he could.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> had ſtood for ſome Months by-gone at 1000 <hi>l</hi> but now Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> being in Earneſt with him he agreed on the following Terms.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. He was to ſerve the Company for the Space of 2 Years in their Expedition, for which the Company was to pay him 750 <hi>l</hi> whereof 50 <hi>l</hi> ready down.</item>
                     <item>2. He was forthwith to proceed to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi> and there to anſwer ſuch Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions as the private Committee or Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Trade ſhould ask him.</item>
                     <item>3. In Conſideration of 20 <hi>Guineas</hi> more, which hethen received in hand, he was to put a Stop to the Publiſhing his Book for the ſpace of a Month; and when he came to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> if the Company and he could not come to Terms for the ſuppreſſing it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then he was either at Liberty to go in their Service for the foreſaid 700 <hi>l</hi> or to return to <hi>England,</hi> which he pleas'd.</item>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:45975:31"/>
                     <item>4. You may eaſily perceive ſomething, Myſtical in the wording of theſe Articles, whereby the Company might ſhake their Neck out of their Nooſe, but that Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi> mean't it ſo, I will not ſay, but am rather willing to believe he was ſincere and ignorant of the Companies Deſign on him.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Wafer,</hi> Purſuant to the Contract, (having order'd his Affairs in <hi>England</hi> for his Voyage to <hi>Darien,</hi>) took Poſt for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and on the Road paſt by the Name of <hi>Brown,</hi> by the Committees Direction. He was ſtopt at <hi>Haddinton,</hi> 12 Miles ſhort of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Pennycook,</hi> who was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to Lodge him at Mr. <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s Houſe, about 2 Miles Wide of that Road, and there he was to ſtay till the Committee ſhould come to him, leaſt by his going into <hi>Edinburgh</hi> he ſhould be ſeen by <hi>Paterſon</hi> or <hi>Lodge,</hi> (who at this Time were kept in the Dark as to the Companies Reſolutions,) or by any other Perſon that might know him. The private Committee came to him next Day, and having enter'd on Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, askt him firſt, if he had order'd his Affairs ſo in <hi>England</hi> that he needed not return. He anſwered that he had, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45975:31"/>was ready to go abroad at 48 Hours warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: To this they reply'd, that it was very well, tho'by the Sequel of the Story you'll find it none of their Meaning.</p>
                  <p>During the firſt 2 or 3 Days Conferences, the Subject of the Diſcourſe was <hi>Darien,</hi> of which he unboſſom'd himſelf freely. And for their further Incouragement, he ingaged to lead them to a Treaſure of <hi>Nicaragua</hi> Wood, whereof 300 Men could cut down ſo much in Six Months, as ſhould defray the whole Charge of the Expeditinn, which if he did not perform he ſhould forfeit his Title to the 700 <hi>l Premium</hi> agreed on. The Gentlement were curious in Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves whereabouts this Treaſure was, whither it was near the Sea or any River whence it could be eaſily Shipt Aboard. <hi>Wafer,</hi> not ſuſpecting any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon him by Perſons of ſo noted Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, reſolv'd them in every Particular, and pointed out the very Spot of Ground, where it grows, with the Bearings and Diſtance of it from Golden <hi>Iſland.</hi> They now think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves Cock-ſure of the Treaſure, and ſufficiently Inſtructed as to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, had no more Occaſion for <hi>Wafer,</hi> and believ'd that the 700 <hi>l</hi> Pilotage might be ſav'd, to help to fetch up <hi>Smith</hi>'s Summ.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:45975:32"/>
                  <p>Next Night he has brought into <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> under Pretence of a nearer Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and was lodg'd in a private Cell near the Companies Office Three Pair of Stairs high, where he could ſcarce diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between Sun Light and Moon Light; and here he was oblig'd to keep cloſe leaſt by being ſeen abroad the Project ſhould take Air. <hi>Wafer</hi> was well enough pleas'd with his Confinement, having ſtill the 700 <hi>l</hi> in View; but as there's no Certainty in Sublunary Things, ſo the <hi>Pilot</hi> miſt of his Mark; for in a Day or two afterwards ſome Gentlement of the Committee came to him and with abundance of Concern, made him underſtand, that the Project had taken Wind in <hi>England,</hi> that Admiral <hi>Bembo</hi> was lying with a Squadnon at <hi>Spithead,</hi> to wait their Motion; and that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd that very Morning, in the Secret Committee, to alter their <hi>Darien</hi> Project. <hi>Wafer</hi> being ſomewhat daunted at the News, had but little to ſay to the Matter: And theſe Gentlemen to blind him the more, ask'd him ſeveral Queſtions about the Rivers of <hi>Platte</hi> and <hi>Amazones</hi> (both 1000 Leagues wide of <hi>Darien,</hi>) and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could be ſerviceable to them that way; to which he anſwered, No.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45975:32"/>
                  <p>Thus they parted from him, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Concern for their own Diſappointment, as well as his; tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him withal, That ſince they could not go in his <hi>Darien</hi> Project, they would think of a Gratuity ſit for him, which he might expect that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>This Gratuity was the Sum of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Guineas,</hi> which he receiv'd by the Hand of Mr. <hi>Pennycook:</hi> And I ſuppoſe he was now at Liberty to Print his Book, for I think he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as Commun'd with about it. I was order'd to ſee him out of Town, which gave me an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of having the mournful Story Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulated, whereof neither he nor I at that time knew the Draught. It was not neceſſary to enjoin <hi>Wafer</hi> to conceal his <hi>Scotch</hi> Journey from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> his own Intereſt obliging him to keep it huſh, ſince the greateſt Remedy he could expect was to be laught at. However, I dare ſay, he hath acquired ſo little Knowledge of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> (except what he learn'd of the Company,) that if he were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45975:33"/>to that City, he could no more find the Way to his Lodging, than the Company could to the <hi>Nicaragua</hi> Wood, notwithſtanding they thought themſelves ſo ſure of it by Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>I was afterwards one of thoſe who went for ſeveral Miles along the Coaſt, in Search of this Treaſure, but were oblig'd to give it o'er: And in Lieu of this, our Men were order'd to fell ſeveral kinds of ſtrange Trees, which naturally grow in the Colony's Garden.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were ſquared and cut in Ten Foot Peices, for the eaſier Stowage, and were to be ſent Home by the firſt Ship, to ſee if the Company's Virtuoſo's could find any <hi>Lebanon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</p>
                  <p>When they come, I dare ſay, they will Puzzle the General Aſſembly to find Names for them all, for I can ſcarce think that Old Nunkle trotted ſo far <hi>Weſt</hi> to Chriſten them.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:45975:33"/>
                  <p>But that I may now take leave of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (whom I am unwilling to part with as yet if it were not for fouling too much Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) and hale my Topſail-ſheets home for my Voyage to <hi>Darien:</hi> I muſt acquaint you that about 7 or 8 months before we ſail'd, a Committee was order'd for the diſpatch of buſineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> for the victualling and ſitting out of the Fleet. I was ordered to aſſiſt at two or three meetings of this Committee with my advice in the Victualling part (that for ſome time before lying within my Province) and they having told me that 900 men was the Compliment they deſign'd for this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that they muſt regulate the daily expence according to the ſtore they had, ſo as to make it hold out 9 months; this was ſoon done, and if we had been ready to ſail then, the Proviſions might have held out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the calculation: but our Maſters being no Witches at their craft a third of their Proviſions were expended before we could be ready to ſail. There was none to be had in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and if there had there was no Money to go to Market; the 100000 <hi>l</hi> being ſunk, and the Companies credit not worth two pence, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the glorious ſhow our Ships made from the Caſtle-hill of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> And I have reaſon to believe, that we had ſtuck there as well as the <hi>Riſing Sun</hi> did in the <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſe,</hi> if it had not been for ſome few Pillars of the Company who mortgag'd their Eſtates
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45975:34"/>for 4 or 5000 <hi>l</hi> for which the Company made over the two new Ships at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and the <hi>Riſing Sun</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for their ſecurity. It was not convenient to let our men know the ill ſtate of our Proviſions; but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, there was ſuch a noiſe made or our plenty, and of our having a twelve months ſtore of all kinds for 1000 men, that it was like to have ſet us all by the ears together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were long at Sea. This management was principally due to Mr. <hi>Robert Blackwood</hi> one of that Committee, a little buſy-body, who took this part of it upon him, and is now in diſgrace for the ſame. Whether he deſerves it altogether himſelf I will not ſay; but however, the Company thinks it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he ſhould be the Sacrifice, altho one half of their Collars is not enough to attone for what ſo many brave Fellows has ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>Having ſail'd from <hi>Leith</hi> about three days I acquainted Mr. <hi>Pennycook</hi> with my doubts as to the Proviſions, and how neceſſary it was the Council ſhould be ſatisfied of our ſtore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were too late. Next day he made the Signal for the Counſellors to repair on board, and the Purſers of the ſeveral Ships were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to lay an account before them of what Proviſions they ſtood charged with. This done, I was ordered to calculate the whole and make a Report how long the ſtore would hold out at the uſual allowance for 1050 men, our Compliment being thereabouts. I could
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45975:34"/>not make above 5 months and a half of any ſpecie except Stock-fiſh, of which we had full 11 months, and that at 4 days of the week, but had not above 4 months Butter and Oyl to it. The Council deſign'd to put into the <hi>Orkney's</hi> to ſend an Expreſs to the Company and give them an account of the ſlate of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, but meeting with thick and bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the paſſing of them, we were obliged to go on; and having calculated that ſtore to hold out 9 months, our men were forthwith put to that ſharp allowance. This occaſion'd ill blood enough, and I was like to have got my throat cut for being the Author of it. As for our Drink, we had not above ten tunn of Beer in our Navy when we left <hi>Leith;</hi> but in lieu thereof we were aſſur'd by the Company, that we ſhould take in Wine at <hi>Madera's,</hi> for which they had ſent us credit on Mr. <hi>Miles,</hi> who had Effects in his hands of one <hi>William Arbuckles</hi> a Director; dut being come thither, we found this to be a miſtake, to ſay no worſe on't. Our men now being at ſuch ſhort allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and no other Drink to truſt to but ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Water, did not know how to brook it well.</p>
                  <p>The Officers and Gentlemen Voluntiers, who had brought but little money with them (being in hopes that there was enough before them) were obliged to ſell their moveables to <hi>Jack Portugueeſe,</hi> ſuch as Scarlet Coats, Clooks and Swords, wherewith they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45975:35"/>a little Wine for themſelves. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate was in the ſame caſe, for they had no Caſh in their Bank, and being under ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſity as <hi>David</hi> was when he eat the Shew-bread, made bold with the ſeveral Ships ſtock-purſes, wherein was only 100 <hi>l</hi> for each Ship, and 10 <hi>l</hi> for each Tender, in caſe they ſhould meet with any diſaſter at' Sea and be oblig'd to be put into a Foreign Port. With this Money, and a few Pipe-ſtaves, they purchas'd 27 Pipes of Wine, and a ſmall recruit of freſh Proviſions. But this would not have gone far, for if it had been ſerv'd out but at a quarter of a pint a day to each man it would not have held out above ſix weeks.</p>
                  <p>That you may taſt a little of our Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as well as I, you muſt know that our Stock-fiſh was the beſt, if there had been a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Butter or Oyl to it. Our Beef was 3 fourths <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and the reſt <hi>Scotch,</hi> both alike ſit for a long Voyage. There was about a fifth part of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſtall-ſed, the reſt graſs Beef, and the whole about 18 months in ſalt. As for our Bread, 27000 <hi>l</hi> weight of it was made up of damnified Wheat which was bought cheap, and the money of it is now in the pocket of a Director, whoſe Chriſtian Name is <hi>Drummellier.</hi> This Bread was not ſit for dogs to eat, but it was a mercy we had a good many <hi>Highlanders</hi> in our Legion, who were not uſed to feed on much of God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that's hallowed. The Pork was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45975:35"/>good, but there being no great ſtore of it aboard we reſerv'd it always for our <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> dinner. As for Cheeſe, we had none, by reaſon, I ſuppoſe, that only ſerves for concoction, or to create an appetite.</p>
                  <p>Thus we march'd as the <hi>Scots</hi> Armies did in former days with their 40 days Proviſions on their backs againſt their Enemies; whom if they did not meet before that term was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd they diſpers'd and went home again. But their caſe and ours differ'd in ſome eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, theſe were never far from home, knew what to truſt to, and if they happen'd to be diſappointed of the Enemies Plunder, they could make bold with their Neighbours Chickens while they were on the Road, and that never reckon'd Stealing: But we were ſent to the back of Gods elbow, where we could ſee nothing but Death, ſtarving and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mines before our Eyes, and although our inclinations were never ſo ſtrong to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row any of our Neighbours goods, yet our power was always deficient.</p>
                  <p>But now to proceed on our Voyage, and give you the remarkable Occurrances of it and of our <hi>Darien</hi> entertainment; you are to know that we left the <hi>Edinburgh Fyrth</hi> on <hi>July</hi> the 17th. 1698, and having fetch'd a turn round the <hi>Orkney's</hi> we arriv'd at <hi>Madera's</hi> about the laſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ſtaid there 5 or 6 days, till we purchas'd the foreſaid 27 Pipes of Wine. Here the Council open'd their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45975:36"/>by which they were ordered to Steer to <hi>Crabb-Iſland,</hi> and take poſſeſſion of it in the name of the Company and Nation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and leave a ſmall deteachment there. This Iſland lies to Leeward of <hi>St. a Cruz,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 9 Leagues, to windward of <hi>Porto-Rico,</hi> about 5 Miles and 18 Leagues from <hi>St. Thomas</hi> a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Iſland. Having made the Iſland of <hi>St. a Cruz,</hi> our Senate order'd the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi> and one of the Tenders into <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> to get ſome Pilates for the Main, and to return to us at <hi>Crabb-Iſland.</hi> While the Council ſat on this occaſion, we drove to the <hi>Northward-moſt</hi> end of <hi>St. a Cruz,</hi> and not being in too much haſt to come to an Anchor at <hi>Crabb-Iſland,</hi> we fetch'd a trip to Windward round <hi>St. a Cruz,</hi> which occaſion'd the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſettlement; for our Miſſioners to <hi>St. Thomas</hi> having innocently ſcatter'd ſome words there of our <hi>Crabb</hi> deſign, the Governour forthwith diſpatch'd a Sloop with ten Men and an Officer to take poſſeſſion of it in the name of <hi>Denmark;</hi> ſo that at our arrival in the Bay, or Road of <hi>Crabb-Iſland,</hi> we could ſee a large Tent aſhore with the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Colours flying. Our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſent aſhore to know the meaning of it, and were made ſenſible that they came too late. Next day the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi> and Tender ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, having brought with them one <hi>Alliſon,</hi> who Commanded a Sloop in that Squadron of Privateers, who had landed at <hi>Golden-Iſland,</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:45975:36"/>and march'd over the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> about 18 Years ago. We were glad of ſuch a Pilot, for there was no Man in our Fleet that had ever been on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſt. We left <hi>Crabb Iſland</hi> the ſecond of <hi>October,</hi> and having met with <hi>Southerly</hi> and <hi>Weſterly</hi> winds for 3 Weeks or a Month together, it was the ſecond of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> before we came to an Anchor on the <hi>Darien</hi> Coaſt. We lay becalm'd a Week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cartagena</hi> and <hi>Cape Tiburoon</hi> (which is the <hi>Weſtermoſt</hi> point of the Gulph of <hi>Darien</hi>) where for want of any Air, but what was Sulphurous, our Men fell down and died like rotten Sheep.</p>
                  <p>We came to an Anchor about 7 Leagues to the <hi>Northweſt</hi> of <hi>Cape Tiburoon,</hi> and altho' we were cloſe by <hi>Golden Iſland,</hi> yet neither our Pilate, nor any perſon elſe knew the Land, till the <hi>Indians</hi> inform'd us. The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi> being the firſt Ship that came to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor ſent her Boat aſhore; where having left an hoſtage with ſome <hi>Indians,</hi> who had a Plantation there, two Canous with a few <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> came on board the Ships. The Canou which came to the <hi>St. Andrew</hi> where I was had Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> on board, who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Companies and Collonies Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord: They were ſome hours aboard before we could make them underſtand us, altho a <hi>Jew</hi> (who was our Linguiſt) endeavour'd it with his <hi>Spaniſh, Portugueſe, French</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> till once they were got drunk with our Punch
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45975:37"/>and <hi>Madera</hi> Wine, and then Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> with his Lieutenant ſpoke it as faſt and much better than our <hi>Jew.</hi> Having got their load they were not able to go aſhore that night; and next day we weigh'd and came into the Bay within <hi>Golden Iſland,</hi> which is about 4 or 5 Miles wide and deep. And having ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our Boats along the ſhore, we found a Lagoon on the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> ſide of this Bay, which runs up within the Land about two Miles and a half; this appearing to be a good Harbour for us, we went into it and Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened it, by the name of <hi>Caledonia</hi> Harbour. The mouth or entry of this Harbour is a large Mile over, and ſo ſteep too on both ſides that a Ship may go ſo near as to throw a Bisket-cake aſhore. One ſide of the Harbour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea is a vaſt Mountain and Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula, being joyn'd to the Main at the bottom of the Harbour, by a neck of low Land, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 3 or 400 Paces over. The extream point of this Peninſula, which makes one ſide of the Harbours mouth, is a low and flat piece of Sandy ground, containing about 30 Acres, and divided from the Peninſula by another neck of 180 Paces over from Sea to Sea. This was pitch'd upon as the ſtrongeſt Sanctuary in caſe of attacks, as likewiſe for the convenience of a battery towards the Harbours mouth: We Chriſten'd this piece of ground by the name <hi>New Edinburgh,</hi> and the Platform of 16 Guns which we made
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45975:37"/>there was call'd <hi>Fort St. Andrew.</hi> The neck of Land was cut through to let the Sea en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs the New City and Fort, and part it from the Peninſula, and within the Treneh a breaſt-work with a Parapet was rais'd, and a half baſtion at each end. On the other ſide of the Trench the Trees were fell'd, and the ground clear'd for a Muſquet-ſhot round, to give us a fair proſpect of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> in caſe of an attack. This piece of ground was the <hi>Scotch</hi> Collony; as for the Peninſula it ſelf, it might have been fortify'd with ſome labour and pains, but not thinking it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to part ſo few men to defend theſe two Poſts, it was reſolv'd by the Council to ſtick cloſe by this and fortify it to the beſtad-vantage. As for the oppoſite point on the Main, which makes the other ſide of the entry into the Harbour, it is a high ridge of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which with a ſharp or edg'd end butts into the Sea, and ſo croſly contriv'd that it would puzzle all the Inginiers in <hi>Europe</hi> to plant a Gun on it that could do any Service. So that at beſt, this Harbour is only a ſhelter from bad weather, the Platform call'd <hi>Fort St. Andrew</hi> being of little uſe to defend it; the Ships in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by bringing a Spring on their Cables, and their Broadſides to bear towards the mouth of the Harbour, might ſerve for ſo advantagious a Battery, as one Ship within the Harbour might be as good as two that came in to attack them, the nature of which ſtrength may eaſily be comprehended by any Seafaring men.</p>

                  <p>But to return to our Landlord and the other <hi>Indians;</hi> Captain <hi>Andreas</hi>'s Plantation was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Mountains, about 4 miles from our Harbour; the extent of his Government was from <hi>Carrit-bay</hi> about 8 or 9 miles on one ſide of us, and <hi>Golden Iſland</hi> about 5 miles on the other ſide, ſuch a portion of Land being the Lairdſhip or Kingdom of theſe Captains whom the <hi>Buccaneers, Privateers</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Company would have to be Kings and Sovereign Princes. At our firſt Landing, Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> came down and lookt on us, and ſeem'd to be well enough ſatisfy'd with his new Tenants (he thinking it in vain to appear otherwiſe, for if he had muſter'd his whole Clan to oppoſe us, 6 of our men with fire-arms were enough to conquer him) but what his ſentiment was will appear by the ſequel. After that Viſit he did not come near us for 3 or 4 weeks; and during this time the mighty noiſe of our Force ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all along that Shore, and the hopes we gave them of reſtoring them to their ancient Liberty and Greatneſs, there came <hi>Canous</hi> with <hi>Indians</hi> from all the neighbouring parts to view us: it was our intereſt to make them wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, ſo that they came daily to us without any dread, and having ſtaid till we were weary of them, went home again with ſome little preſents of Beads, Looking-glaſſes, or Knives. About the ſame time Captain <hi>Ambroſio</hi> came from the Weſtward to us, with a <hi>Periaga</hi> full of <hi>Indians,</hi> to the number of 30, including Men, Women and Children, (for when they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45975:38"/>travel they carry their whole Families with them) and having come within half a mile of our Ships they ſet up a Flag of Truce, and lay on their Oars till our Pinnaces went out and aſſur'd them that they ſhould be ſafe. This <hi>Ambroſio</hi> is one of their greateſt Captains, and at preſent an Outlaw, or if you will, at war with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> having murder'd 10 of them at the Iſle of <hi>Pines</hi> ſometime agoe: his Plantation and Government is about 50 miles to Leeward of the Collony, and about half way between and the <hi>Samballa</hi>'s Iſlands. He was made very welcom, ſtaid 2 or 3 days, and told us that we were not ſafe in Captain <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas</hi>'s Ground by reaſon he was a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and a very <hi>Spaniard</hi> in his heart, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſeem'd to be well enough ſatisfy'd with our landing in his Ground, yet he was not to be truſted but came purely with a deſign to ſpy us. Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> abſenting himſelf ſo long from the Collony added to the ſame ſuſpicion, and our Senatours being reſolv'd to know more of it, 3 of their number went on a Viſit to his Plantation, and having enter'd his <hi>Wigwam</hi> (or Cage-like houſe) he ſat ſtill on his Seat without ſaying one word to them, or ſeeming to know that he ever had ſeen them before, although he was made heartily drunk at both the times he was on board. Mr. <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nycook</hi> and the others having met with this cold Entertainment from Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> (for they were not offer'd ſo much as a Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or Callabaſh of Drink, which is the uſual
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45975:39"/>Entertainment the <hi>Indians</hi> give to their Friends at their firſt entry) came home again confirm'd of what <hi>Ambroſio</hi> and the other <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> had hitherto ſaid. The next time Capt. <hi>Ambroſio</hi> came he inſiſted on the ſame ſtory, and would needs perſwade us to remove from that place and come nearer to him, where we needed not apprehend any betraying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign from him by reaſon his killing of theſe 10 <hi>Spaniards</hi> at the Iſle of <hi>Pines,</hi> and taking that <hi>Periaga</hi> with a braſs <hi>Pitterara</hi> could never be forgiven by them. Our Council met on this occaſion, where it was order'd that <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nycook, Montgomery, Macay</hi> and <hi>Pinparton</hi> Counſellors, with <hi>Robert Drummond</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the <hi>Caledonia</hi> ſhould go to <hi>Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio</hi>'s, with the Long-boats and Pinnaces mann'd with 70 Fire-arms, and on their way to ſound all the Harbours along the Coaſt. I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd by theſe Gentlemen to go with them, and having ſtopt the firſt Night at the Iſle of <hi>Pines,</hi> 6 Leagues to Leeward of the Collony, where Captain <hi>Long</hi> was riding in His Majeſty's Ship the <hi>Rupert Prize,</hi> we lodg'd that Night on Board with him. The next day we proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on our Expedition ſounding the Coaſt, where we ſound ſome good Harbours that were able to contain all the Navy of <hi>England,</hi> but they could not be fortify'd ſo as to hinder the Enemy from coming in. When we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civ'd at <hi>Ambroſio's</hi> little River or Brook we lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and were Piloted by his Son Captain <hi>Pedro</hi> to the Plantation, which is about a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45975:39"/>league from the Sea, and is ſo cunning and obſcure, that without a Guide it is impoſſible for any man to find the way to it. We croſt one River eleven times, wading always up to the middle, and I believe we could have gone a nearer way if they would, but they do this deſignedly, that the Path or Road may not be found out by the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Being arriv'd at the Plantation, Captain <hi>Ambroſio</hi> came out of his Wigwam about 30 Paces and welcom'd us, he had a white Cotton Frock on fring'd at the bottom, and his Court or Clann behind him (who were all mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd on this occaſion) to the number of thirty men beſides Women and Children; they were in ſuch Frocks as <hi>Ambroſio</hi>'s, and had ſhort Lances in their hands: He carry'd us into his Wigwam, and his Wives gave every one of us a Plantain and Callabaſh of their drink (which is made of <hi>Indian</hi> Corn, and like unboil'd Flummery) this being all the Food we got till the next day at noon we came down to our Boats, except a diſh of mine'd Meat of Wild Hogg, wherein was about two pound of Meat, which ſerv'd to give us a taſt of their fineſt Cheer. We hung in Hammocks that Night in <hi>Ambroſio</hi>'s Wigwam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his and his Son <hi>Pedro</hi>'s Wives, and our men lay without round a large Fire that was made for them. Next morning <hi>Ambroſio</hi> went out betimes with 3 or 4 of his men to hunt for us, but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no appearance of his return at noon, and our Belliers crying Cupboard, we did not ſtay to bid him fare well; and his Son Captain <hi>Pedro</hi> having re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us to the Sea ſide, deſir'd the Linguiſt to tell Captain <hi>Pennycook,</hi> that his Father and he expected ſome Preſent for that Entertainment. We had brought nothing with us at that time, ſo told him, that the next time his Father came to the Collony the Council would thank him, and give him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which afterwards was two pieces of <hi>Scotch</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:45975:40"/>Cloth, two Fire-locks, and ſome Pouder, with a few Shot, wherewith he was mightily pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>Having return'd to the Collony, and a Report of the Expedition being made in Council, and the Port where we were reckon'd the moſt ſecure, it was reſolv'd to remain there, diſpatch the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with all expedition, and make the beſt Bargain with <hi>Andreas</hi> we could. On the laſt of <hi>November,</hi> being St. <hi>Andrew's,</hi> day, it was manag'd ſo (but how I cannot reſolve you) that Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> where was a Feſtival on the account of the Day, and he being ask'd by the Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſt, why he was ſo uncivil to the Councellours when they came to viſit him in his Plantation, he anſwer'd, That he meant no harm, and that they muſt impute it to his Ignorance of the <hi>European</hi> Cuſtoms (altho' this Tale could not come well from one that was bred among the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) and not to his want of good-will. He was deſir'd to ſit down and ſhare with them, the Linguiſt telling him the occaſion of that Feaſt.</p>
                  <p>After Dinner, the great Bowl of Punch being ſet on the Table (the ſight of which was pleaſant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to <hi>Andreas</hi>) the Council was reſolv'd to puſh the thing home, and told him what <hi>Ambroſio</hi> and the other <hi>Indians</hi> ſaid of him; to which he reply'd almoſt <hi>verbatim,</hi> as follows, That he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that he was a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain, and had been ſo a long time; that the reaſon of his ſhewing the Collony ſo little Countenance was, by reaſon ſome<note n="*" place="margin">See Hiſtory Buchaneers.</note> 16 or 17 years paſt, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> landed in that very Ground, being 12 or 13 hundred in number, and made them believe they were come to free them from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke, and reſtore them to their own Country; his Friends and Relations join'd and aſſiſted them at the taking of <hi>Sancta Maria</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Towns on the <hi>South Sea,</hi> and likewiſe ſerv'd on
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45975:40"/>board their Ships with them in their <hi>South Sea</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, till at two years end they found, that all their deſign was on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plunder, and having got that, leſt them expos'd to the Cruelty of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who have cut off moſt of the <hi>Indians</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and that for ſeveral Years they were oblig'd to live obſcurely in the Mountains; as for himſelf and Friends, they were oblig'd to accept of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>'s Terms; but at the ſame time, if he thought that the Collony were ſincere, and that their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could protect him and this Kindred, he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to break with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and join with them. Few words more were made of it, the Council ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of his proſer, and promis'd great things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the Nation, and the Secretary was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd immediately to make out a Commiſſion for <hi>Andreas.</hi> It was made on Parchment with the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies Seal and a fine Ribband affixt to it, the tenor whereof run thus. Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> having deſir'd Protection from the Collony for himſelf and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Indians</hi> under him, the Council does hereby take him and them into their Protection, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the foreſaid <hi>Andreas</hi> to be one of their <hi>Scots</hi> Collonies Captains, to command all the <hi>Indians</hi> that's already in his Ground, and to fight againſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Enemies of the Collony of what Nation ſoever. This Commiſſion was wrote in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and read to him by the <hi>Jew</hi> in <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> and for the more ſolemnity of the thing, the Council gave him one of the Long-Boats Jacks to wear in his <hi>Canou,</hi> a Fuzee, and a pair of Piſtols, and a Basket-hilted Sword, and fir'd 21 Guns at his Inauguration. In the Evening Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> went aſhore with his Flag ſlying and the other enſigns of his Honour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept The Commiſſion, which I found the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cram'd into a Locker of the Round-houſe where empty Bottles lay.

                  <p>The Collony's Affair continu'd thus till <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> during which time the Neighbouring <hi>Indian</hi> Captains came to viſit us, to wit, Captain <hi>Poſſigo,</hi> young <hi>Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> another <hi>Pedro Antonio,</hi> and <hi>Nicola,</hi> who gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſed to rail at one another behind their Backs, but all agreed that <hi>Andreas</hi> was not to be truſted notwithſtanding his new Commiſſion. <hi>Ambroſio</hi> was with us during the <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> Holy-days, and having met with Caprain <hi>Andreas</hi> on Board the St. <hi>Andrew</hi> (whom he always look'd on as his mortal Enemy) reproach'd him with his Villany, by telling him, that he was ſtill a <hi>Spaniard</hi> altho' he took the Collony's Commiſſion: This occaſion'd ſome blows between them, and both Parties were going to fall on, if they had not been parted by our Seamen. They were kept aſunder till the Evening, and then Mr. <hi>Pennycook</hi> perſuading <hi>Ambroſio</hi> to be reconcil'd to him (or at leaſt, to appear ſo) a Bowl was made and the Friendſhip made up, they ſeem'd then to be good Friends all that Night, till about the time that they were to go to ſleep, poor Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fellor was tumbl'd down the main Hatch-way into the Hold, where lighting on a ſpare Anchor that lay there, he was ſo bruiz'd that he gave up the ghoſt ſoon afterwards. No body could tell how this accident happen'd, only two things were remarkable in it: That the Hatches of the Hold were always lock'd down at Nights by reaſon the ſharpneſs of our Diet made ſome Men watch all opportunities of getting into the Hold where the Oatmeal and Beef lay, but they were fairly open this Night. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, that there was no care taken while he was aboard to bleed him, or give him any thing inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keep the Blood fluid and from ſettling on the bruiz'd parts, but laid him up till next Day his Wife and Relations carry'd him a-ſhore double.</p>

                  <p>Captain or King <hi>Andreas</hi> having made his <hi>Exit</hi> thus, his Brother-in-Law Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Pedro,</hi> with the intereſt or advice of the Senate, was Seated on his Throne, and he prov'd ſo friendly to the Collony that about 12 days after his Advancement a Party of <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the number of 26, being ſent to view the <hi>Scots,</hi> came ſtreight to Captain <hi>Pedro</hi>'s or <hi>Andreas</hi> his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſiring ſome of his Men to Pilot them to ſome convenient place where they might view the <hi>Scots</hi> Fortification and Ships, theſe <hi>Indians</hi> ingaged it, but advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to lie cloſs for a day or two, untill they view'd whether or no the Coaſt was clear and no <hi>Scots</hi> Parties abroad, So having poſted them on the ſide of a ſmall River, left them and inform'd the Collony of what they had done: On which Captain <hi>Montgomery</hi> Detach'd a Party of a 100 Men, and went round in their Boats, carrying theſe <hi>Indians</hi> along with them: as they were rowing up this narrow River, the In lians of a ſudden gave the Hollow, that the <hi>Scots</hi> might know they were upon them, but before they could fee any body by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the thickneſs of the Woods, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> pour'd in a Volley of ſmall Shot amongſt them, kill'd one Enſign <hi>Sainton,</hi> with two more, and wounded 14, and then run as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:45975:43"/>faſt as they could, our Men Landed and perſu'd them, but caught none of them, ſave this <hi>Domingo de la Rada,</hi> and two more Common Soldiers, of whom the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the <hi>Flying-Poſt</hi> have made ſuch a noiſe theſe five or ſix Months paſt.</p>
                  <p>This is the ground of the Companies title to the Iſthmus of <hi>Darien,</hi> and that was the Bloody Fight wherein ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of <hi>Spaniards</hi> were kill'd and taken Priſoners. Our Men being reduc'd to the foremention'd ſhort Allowance, and wrought every day from Sun to Sun in felling of Trees, and Fortifying themſelves, and feeing but little appearance of the Riches they were told of, began to be very faint-hearted. Several deſerted from the Shore, and ſome of our beſt Men from the Ships, no body knew whether; and eight or nine of thoſe who were caught and brought back again confeſs'd that they were going in to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> where they might expect more Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals and leſs Slavery than what they had there.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding theſe general murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Council could not augment the Allowance, without runing the hazard of ſtarving a Month or two ſooner, for there's no kind of Food to be had in that Mountainous &amp; Woody Country, ſave Plantains, Bonnano's
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45975:43"/>Potato's and Indian Corn, which are ſo ſcarce by reaſon of the few Natives, that our Men ſold their New Shirts to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians for 20 or 24 Plantains a piece, which would not ſerve a Man above three or four days, and our Council were oblig'd to give ſtrict Orders that no Man ſhould ſell his Cloaths, elſe I verily believe our Men had been naked in two months after our Landing. They were oblig'd to a certain Animal call'd a Sojour, which is a ſmall Land Crab, that is hous'd in a ſhell like that of a Wilk; Theſe Sojours were very plentiful at our firſt Landing, but they ſoon fail'd; and then our Men eat the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner rind of the bark of great Iree, which was not unpleaſant to the taſt, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of no nouriſhment, and thought to be unwholeſome, they were diſcharged to eat of it. I doubt not but there's plenty of Fiſh on that Coaſt, but our Company fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing us only with a ſmall. Net made of Packthread for each Ship, they could catch no more in a day than what ſerv'd the Counſellors and Sea Captains; and theſe Nets ſoon fail'd too. We made a ſhift to make a couple of Turtle Nets out of the ſtore of Lines or ſmall Cord we had aboard, but then we had not a Veſſel that was fit to go a Turtling, till after ſome
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45975:44"/>time, two of the <hi>Jamaico</hi> Sloops who had brought and ſold their Cargo of Proviſions to the Collony were hir'd by them to Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for them: Theſe Sloops ſtaid about a month in their Service, till they had got ſo many Turtle for them as by contract came to a 100 and odd Pounds, and finding that there was neither Money nor Money's worth to be had in the Collony, they broke off with them, and with much a do could get ſo much Money as to ſatisfie them for their Service. They had ſome dependance on the wreck of a French Ship which wascaſt away coming out of the Harbour the day before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> ſhe having near 40000 <hi>l</hi> in Doubloons and Dollars on board, which ſhe had got by trading on the Spaniſh Coaſt, but I am told by ſome perſons who are come home ſince I came, that they could not recover any thing of it, by reaſon of the continual ſwell that beats on that ſhore. Here (in Parentheſi) I was Shipwrack:d, had my Servant drow'd, and loſt the few Goods I had with Bag and Baggage, and if it had not been for the little Money which I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved I had not found the way home as yet: As for the Gold and Riches of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I heard enough but ſaw little of it; I preſume if there were ſuch ſtore, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> would not have left it ſo expos'd.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45975:44"/>Theſe Kings or Captains who came down to us might bring perhaps half an Ounce or an Ounce at a time with them and ſell it for Powder and Shot, and at firſt for a ſpeckled Shirt, but there came ſo little of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity amongſt us that it would be long time before a Man could load his Pocket with it, much leſs a Dutch built Ship. What Gold I purchas'd there it coſt me 3 <hi>l</hi> 10 <hi>s. per</hi> ounce, and I believe I brought as much of it away with me to <hi>England</hi> as moſt of thoſe Counſellors who are come home ſince, notwithſtanding the noiſe which they made of it.</p>
                  <p>I left the Collony the 27th of <hi>December,</hi> at the ſame allowance as we were reduc'd to in <hi>July,</hi> when we left <hi>Scotland;</hi> only there was an allowance of <hi>Madera</hi> Wine after our Landing, to wit, an Engliſh Quart to a Meſs (being 5 Men) once a Week: Two Quarts to each Captain once a Week, of which theſe Gentlemen made only one want, and the Night they got their Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they went as merry to Bed as if they had been in their Winter Quarters at <hi>Ghent</hi> or <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> altho they were ablig'd to drink fair Water for a Week afterwards: As for the Subalterns, when I came off, they were not allow'd one Spoonful.</p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:45975:45"/>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how a 1050 Men were ſent by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company on a blind Project, of getting Riches for them with five or ſix months Allowance at moſt, no Credit, and a ridiculous Cargo, neglected by them, and expos'd to Famine Death and the Spaniſh Mines. How the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will ſhake this miſcariage from off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves I cannot ſee: However, I will give you a ſample of what they will be ready to offer in their own vindication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Their being baulkt of their fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Subſcriptions made them loſe Time and Money, whereby they could not ſend out ſuch a number of Men and quantity of Proviſions as the Project would have requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But who is to blame for this, why ſhould they truſt to another Man's Purſe till ſuch time they are ſure of it? Why did they prodigally throw away 50000 <hi>l</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Hambrough</hi> (purely to make a bluſter there) when they could have bought 3 Second-hand-Ships as fit for their Project, for the third of the Money? And ſince their deſign was to ſettle a Collony and Forts on the North and South Seas, why did not they apply themſelves rightly to it? That which might have been honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſav'd out of this 50000 <hi>l</hi> might have carried over above 2000 Men with 12 months
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:45975:45"/>Proviſions of every Specie at good allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. I have made this appear in <hi>Scotland</hi> ſome time ago, and ſince to ſome of the greateſt Men in the Company.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon they will be apt to offer is this, the Ships were Mann'd, the Sea-men and Land-men Liſted and on board, no Proviſions to be had in <hi>Scotland,</hi> while more were providing abroad, theſe aboard ſtill were expending; beſides, there was no Money in the Caſh-room, nor any more to be had from the Subſcribers, till once the Ships were ſail'd, many being ſo ſick of the Project, that they doubted whether they ſhould ever paſs the Baſs. If this ſhould be allow'd to paſs for Current it may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ask'd whether five or ſix Months Proviſions ſhould have laſted to this time. If ever they expected to hear any more of their Ships, ought they not to have call'd in more Money on our departure, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Proviſions inſtantly, and had Ships with us by <hi>Christmas,</hi> or <hi>January</hi> at fartheſt; whereas none ſail'd from <hi>Leith</hi> till <hi>May,</hi> which was near two Months after they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Collonies Packet. If they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ignorant of our neceſſity before this Packet came, they had no excuſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they knew our want, as like wife that they had not ſent a Groats-worth of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45975:46"/>Credit with us to any part of the World, altho now when its too late, they have made a faſhion of doing it in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Reaſon they will make great uſe of is this, that at the ſetling of <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>Weſt-india</hi> Iſlands, as likewiſe the <hi>American</hi> ſettlements on the Main, the People met with a great many hardſhips, and the like are to be expected at the beginning of all ſuch Settlements. To this I anſwer, that at ſuch Settlements the Undertakers and Planters know what they are going about, and what to truſt to, which is no ways parallel with the Caſe of the Company, for thoſe being on an honeſt deſign had no more in their view than the Bleſſings of Heaven, and the Product of the Earth, and what they reap'd thereby was for their own uſe. On the other hand the Gentlemen who went in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Service, were not born to Work, nor did they deſign it when they went from their Fathers Houſes, and this the Company knew full as well as they.</p>
                  <p>A fourth reaſon they will offer is this, that they ſent a Cargo with us, which might have purchas'd Proviſions had it not been for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> prohibition. To this <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that the Company having ſent
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45975:46"/>us on ſo dark an Errand, (where they muſt needs be aſſur'd, that not only <hi>Spain,</hi> but the other Trading Nations would be in our top) ſhould not have truſted to that, unleſs they contriv'd it deſignedly to pick a quarrel with thoſe Nations whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt it was to refuſe us Proviſions or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries to ſupport our Collony. As for the Cargo it ſelf, I refer my felf to the particulars, and let any Merchant be Judge, whether it was fitted for ſale, eſpecially in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> The 1500 Fuzzes were the beſt of the Cargo, but they could not be parted with; the Linnen was the next, but I have been aſſur'd by Merchants on <hi>Port-royal,</hi> that 500 <hi>l</hi> worth of <hi>Scorch</hi> cloath makes the Commodity a drug there at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time. Beſides, altho' we had not been ſent on a dark deſign, yet we cou'd not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to Trade with <hi>Jamaico;</hi> our Cloath and other Goods are ſeizable there, either in our Bottoms, or in their. Sloops. if the <hi>Jamaico</hi> Men ſhould truck Proviſions with us, they cannot carry our goods home with them, neither can they expect to Trade with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> on the account of our Settlement. I know very well that the firſt Sloop which brought Proviſions to us, ſold them at what rate they pleas'd, and had our <hi>Scotch</hi> Cloath in truck at the prime coſt, yet they durſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45975:47"/>not carry it to <hi>Jamaico,</hi> nor venture to Trade with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but were oblig'd to leave it behind with Captain <hi>Alliſon,</hi> the old Buccaneer, to whom the Sloop was conſign'd. Lur ſtill this reaſon of the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition will not hold Water, for if there had been Money or market Goods in the Collony. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> prohibition could not have kept Proviſions from us. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands were not confin'd by this Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I dare ſay there are ſo many good Chriſtians at <hi>Curraſſa,</hi> that if <hi>Redp.</hi> and B's ſtory of the Collonies bars of Silver had been true, they would ſoon have made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions a drug in <hi>Caledonia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, I can't think that the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had any influence on thoſe four Sloops who went from <hi>Jamaico</hi> to the Collony laden with Proviſions of all kinds, altho' two of them return'd without breaking bulk, I am rather apt to believe it was for want of thoſe Silver bars and gold duſt, which in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſhakes off the Trees there.</p>
                  <p>As to the prohibition in ſelf, whereon the Author of the defence ſtumbles ſo oft, and would gladly found the Baſis of his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. 'Tis believ'd that his Majeſty knew nothing of the Collonies Settlenient at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien,</hi> but what he had at ſecond hand from <hi>R—th</hi>'s Prints, till the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45975:47"/>told him from his Maſter, that ſome of his Majeſty's <hi>Scotch</hi> Subjects had invaded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions, in his Province of <hi>Darien,</hi> which he look'd upon to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Treaty of Peace. If his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſtopt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> mouth for the preſent, till he inquired into the matter, and forbid his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> to have any Communication with theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Darien,</hi> till ſuch time as the Title were concerted, he did no more than what was conſonant with the Conſtitutions and Eſlabliſhment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Iſlands, altho' there had been no <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Compla<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

And if the King ſorb.d theſe to ſupply the <hi>Scotch</hi> Collony, he did not prohibit the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company, not <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation to ſend them what Provisions, or other neceſiaries they thought nt. If the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company took moſt care to ſend out Buccaneers Pieces, with great quantities of Powder and Shot, and truſted to what Men they could decoy from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Iſlands, the defign was neither fair, nor honeſt, and it may reaſonably be believ'd, that both theſe Nations would have taken meaſures
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45975:48"/>to bring them back again after they went. And if his Majeſty takes care that his Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Forreſts, he can't be blam'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the vaſt Riches they ſend home to <hi>England</hi> yearly, and the Cuſtoms which come into his Coffers, when on the other hand, all that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company can make by ſuch depopulations, will not put one Peny in his Pocket theſe ſeventeen years at ſooneſt, worth the product of ſeventeen Hogſheads of Tobaccco.</p>
                  <p>Laying aſide the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Complaint and admit the <hi>Scotch</hi> Company to have a legal Title to their Settlement, was it not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that the Government of <hi>England,</hi> having met with the clandeſtine Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which the <hi>Scotch</hi> Collony had ſpread all over the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> inviting them over to <hi>Darien,</hi> &amp;c. Should take ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table meaſures to prevent the ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſame, and retain their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The Declarations are notorious, and muſt be penn'd by ſome Body belonging to the Company or Collony, and I preſume the oppoſite Proclamation or Prohibition was penn'd by ſome <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who had ſome Intereſt in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations. 'Tis very well known that when Captain <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carton</hi> met with the misfortue of being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45975:48"/>to run his Veſſel aſhore under the Guns of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> his Chief Errand was to <hi>Barhadoes,</hi> and there to make uſe of the 48 hours (that's allow'd to foreigners to Wood and Water) in doing buſineſs for the Collony, and leaving Declarations to be ſpread over that Iſland; and ſo from thence to other <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Iſlands, making uſe of the ſame Pretence of wanting Wood and Water. Theſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter dealings are not ſuffered in the Collony of any Nation, and if the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Governments take care to prevent ſuch deſigns, I cannot ſee how they can be blaim'd: 'Tis very well known that thoſe Declarations were ſo kindly entertain'd all over the <hi>Weſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> that what with the Umbrary uſe that was made of King <hi>William</hi>'s name, and the hopes of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Spoil, moſt Men who were not Indu'd with Real or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Eſtate, were making ready to go over to <hi>Darien:</hi> Nay the unthinking ſort of People about the City of <hi>London,</hi> on the Coin'd Rhodomantado News, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the non-authoriz'd Prints were dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtuft, were pleas'd and big with the Project, looking no farther into in than <hi>Jacks Gold,</hi> which they natively believe every body has a right to; when at the ſame time

                  <p>By what has been already ſaid, it may eaſily appear whether or no theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have ſtaid long enough in <hi>Darien,</hi> and whether the director, of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or they deſerve moſt to be there at this Minuet.

                  <p>Being afflicted with a <hi>Mallady imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naire</hi> for ſome Months before I came off: I purchas'd my Liberty of the Collony with difficulty enough: About the ſame time the Counſel having reſolv'd to ſend home one of their Tenders with a Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et to the Company, and a ſample of the ſtrange Woods that grow in the Collonies Garden, I thought to have got my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in her, but was diſappointed by a State Reaſon, which was thus, Major <hi>Cunningham</hi> was the chief Inſtrument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contriving and forwarding the Expreſs, and having brought his marks to bear,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:45975:49"/>ſo far as that the Veſſel was Carreen'd, Tallow'd and fitted for the Voyage, he was ſudden'ly afflicted with my Diſtempar, and it ſeiz'd him ſo violently that on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of his illneſs he call'd a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil (being Preſes for the week) and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied them that he muſt leave them and go home to his native Country, for the recovery of his Health. <hi>Pannycook</hi> and <hi>Macay</hi> ſmelling a rat, us'd both fair and foul means to detain him, but all would not do. Mean while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd ways to detain the Veſſel till the Majors Preſeſhip was out, and the week following, it was Reſolv'd in Council <hi>Nemine Contradicente</hi> (except the Major) to take ſome other way of ſending home the Packet, and to convert the Tender into a Fireſhip: The Majors Tallent not lying in Sea Engagements, he could not offer much aginſt the neceſſity of it. About the ſame time the <hi>French</hi> Ship mention'd before, happen'd to put into our Harbour, as like wiſe a <hi>Hollands</hi> Ship, that was trading on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſt, and came hither for Sanctuary, the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levanto</hi> Fleet being on the <hi>Carthagena</hi> Coaſt: The <hi>French</hi> Ship was bound home to St. <hi>Malo,</hi>'s and I deſign'd to take my Paſſage in her, but the Major
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45975:50"/>being poſſeſt with ſome frightful Stories of the <hi>French</hi> Captain's making an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of him to the Governour of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena,</hi> would not venture in her. The Ship was caſt away going out of the Harbour in fair weather, for want of Wind, and 24 of her Men drowned: I eſcaped narrowly in Mr. <hi>Pennycook</hi>'s Boat, while he was forc'd to ſwim for his Life. A <hi>Jamaico</hi> Sloop having brought ſome Proviſions to the Collony about the ſame time, and being bound home, the Mayor and I took our Paſſage in her.</p>
                  <p>We left the Collony the 27th. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> arriv'd in <hi>Jamaico</hi> a fortnight af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, and in <hi>Briſtol</hi> the 18th of <hi>March</hi> laſt, where the Major and I parted, he going for <hi>Scotland</hi> and I for <hi>London:</hi> At our parting he would oblidge me to write nothing to <hi>Scotland</hi> in prejudice of the <hi>Darien</hi> Project, and I promiſed him that he ſhould have ſuch liberty in telling his own Story there, that for the ſpace of two Months I ſhould not write concerning it, Directly or Indirectly, which promiſe I kept Religiouſly, although as it has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd my ſilence has not been of much ſervice to the Company.</p>

Two thirds of the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation here in Town were on my Top; and abus'd me to my Back, like any Beggar. This and ſome other harſh uſage, which I receiv'd at the <hi>Scotch</hi> Companies hands, oblig'd me to take this way of righting my ſelf: I have no other aim by it, then that their Actions may be laid bare-fac'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Scotch</hi> World, that ſome perſons of that Nation may be unblinded, and ſee how far they have been led into a miſtake.</p>

He argued in favour of the Company, in ſome Law Terms, wherein I pretend to no Judgment, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than my Reaſon will fathom; and urg'd that by the Civil-Law no Title to any Country, can be vallid unleſs it be <hi>de Facto</hi> as well as <hi>Jure,</hi> and thoſe he diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd thus, all the <hi>de june</hi> right which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had to <hi>Darien</hi> was the Pope's Donation, which is never regarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Proteſtant Princes; That the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> had no poſſeſſion <hi>de facto</hi> of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45975:54"/>unleſs he liv'd on the Spot, or had his Cattle running there.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt I anſwer'd, that if the <hi>Scots</hi> had been in <hi>Darien</hi> as ſoon as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and taken poſſeſſion of it, the Companies Donation might have been as valid as the Pope's, but as theſe have been maſters of that Country by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of years, and their Title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to never hitherto contraverted by any Prince or State till now by the Company. I could not ſee how at that rate any Collony or Plantation in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe can be ſafe. The <hi>Spaniaras</hi> muſt either be confin'd within their wall'd Towns, and the reach of their Guns, or they muſt be allowed the uſual extent round them, as all other Collonies in <hi>America</hi> have. The Company might with the ſame Juſtice Land on the North-ſide of <hi>Jamaico,</hi> where, for 20 Leagues running there's neither <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man nor Beaſt to be ſeen, altho' there are as many, if not more, Wild Negroes in the Mountains of <hi>Jamaico,</hi> who have deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Maſters than <hi>Indians,</hi> on thrice ſo much ground of the Iſthmus of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien.</hi> By the ſame Title the Company might have ſeated themſelves on the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland of <hi>Tobaga</hi> (where there's never a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:45975:55"/>Man) without asking the D. of <hi>Courland</hi>'s leave. On the other hand, the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny has ſettled their Collony in the very Boſom and Centre of the three chieſ Cities of the <hi>Spaniſh-Indies,</hi> to wit, <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena, Portobello,</hi> and <hi>Panama,</hi> the firſt being about 45 Leagues, and the other two not above 30 diſtant from the Collony, beſides ſeveral ſmaller Towns and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons which are much nearer, <hi>viz, Sancta Maria, Tubaconti, &amp;c.</hi> Nay the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are at work in their Mines within 12 Leagues of Fort St. <hi>Andrew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>de facto</hi> right, 'tis evident that theſe Captains who are over the Indian Clanns, have <hi>Spaniſh</hi> names to diſtinguiſh them from the Vulgar, ſpeak <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, their Wives go valed and cover'd after the ſame faſhion, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women go, altho their Men go naked: Beſides, one Paragraph of the Collonies Journal makes this very Spot of Ground where they are ſettled, to be the Propriety of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> by their acknowledging Captain <hi>Andreas</hi> to have been a Spaniſh Captain.

The Privateers indeed gave the title of King Golden Cap to the Indian Captains Son, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded theſe Indians near <hi>Golden Iſland,</hi> and he was this <hi>Andreas</hi> his firſt Couſin, but kill'd by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> after the Privateers left the Iſthmus, as thoſe may now be who entertained the <hi>Scots</hi> ſo friendly. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> admitting ſome <hi>French</hi> Troops into their Country does not take away the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Title and Right to that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Title is likewiſe confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Conceſſion of all Princes, and Treaties of Peace, whereby the <hi>Spaniard</hi> does not only cut off the People of all Nations whom he finds cutting Logwood in the Bay of <hi>Campechy</hi> (a great many Leagues diſtant from any <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Town) but keeps the <hi>Barlevento</hi> Fleet, and an <hi>Armadilla</hi> always ranging along that Coaſt, and makes prize of all Foreigners he finds trading on his Coaſt, without his Commiſſion; If they have ſo much as a ſtick of Logwood, or three pieces of Eight aboard: Which if hed did not act Legally, to be ſure the Soveraign heads
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45975:56"/>of thoſe Subjects, would long e're now have demanded ſatisfaction or made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal.</p>
                  <p>This was the Subſtance of what I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to Sir <hi>J. S.</hi> and what uſe he made of it, I never inquir'd after, as for that part of the Champions defence deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Iſthumes of <hi>Darien,</hi> I muſt tell you that it is calculated in all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial paſſages of it for a <hi>Scotch</hi> Meridian, as the <hi>Darien</hi> News were for ſix Months by the Companies Agents here in Town, who knew that what was Printed here and ſent to <hi>Scotland</hi> was far better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd than the <hi>Apocrypha.</hi> The <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brugh.</hi> News-monger was never wanting on his part, for he ſtill had ſomething new from St. <hi>Germains</hi> to frighten us with the Cabals there, and private meetings between, the late King <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Lovis,</hi> but however neceſſany ſuch hob-goblin ſtories might been an inchanted Country, yet they never went down within the found of <hi>Bow-bel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Champions endeavouring to prove the <hi>Scots</hi> intereſt by a ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I will excuſe my ſelf from medling with that part of the Subject, knowing at the ſame time that the Wiſemen of that Country know the benefit of that Union
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:45975:56"/>better than this Author, or ſome more, who make uſe of the Machin of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony to ſet the two Nations together by the ears, the better to advance their own private Ends. As for his other, fiery E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculations, I have no inclination to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with them, their being little to be got on either ſide, by ripping up of ſuch Sores; and it not belonging to me to ſay any thing on that Head, I'll take my leave of the Company and their Champion at preſent, and only ſay that if he is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſeparate, I would have him pick ſome quarrel that's honeſter than this, and the next time he enters the Liſts, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vande juſter reaſons for it, than what he now does for <hi>Caledonia Noviſſima.</hi>

                  <head>The Introduction.</head>
                  <p>THE juſt Horrour that all honeſt men conceiv'd at the harſh and unneighbourly Treatment of the Scots Colony at <hi>Darien,</hi> laid the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have been moſt active againſt it, under a neceſſity of blackening the Reputation of thoſe concern'd in that Settlement. This they thought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in order to prevent any enquiry, that perhaps might be made: Why a Neighbouring Nation united to the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> by Situation, Government, Intereſt, Religion, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and conſtant Inter-marriages, ſhould be provok'd and trampl'd upon in ſuch a manner, contrary to their own Laws and Original Conſtitution, and which may pave the way in time for Treating our Neighbours in the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>To prevent any ſuch Enquiry, thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:45975:59"/>Gentlemen that have been pleas'd to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize themſelves as much by their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the Scotiſh Nation, as the latter have ſignalized their Valour and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for our common Liberty and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have been at pains and expence to ſave the Libeller <hi>H—s</hi> from the Gallows, by putting a ſtop to his Trial, and filling his Pockets with Money, on condition that he would beſpatter the Reputation of the Scots Colony and their Maſters. The Crime is indeed unnatural for a man to turn Renegado and a Traitor to his Country; none but a Monſter like <hi>H</hi>— the Surgeon could have entertain'd ſuch a Thought: He ſold his God in the Laſt Reign, by turning Papiſt, and therefore 'tis no great Wonder he ſhould ſell his Country in this, and ſolemnly renounce his going Northward for ever, provided he might he ſecur'd againſt going Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for once.</p>
                  <p>This being the Caſe of the Doughty Evidence, that the Faction have produced againſt the Scots Colony; we leave it to the World to judg what credit ought to
<pb facs="tcp:45975:59"/>be given to his Teſtimony, ſince it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that he harh giv'n it in to ſave his Life, to gain Money, and to give vent to his Malice. The latter he owns in the beginning of his Book, and repeats it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>p.</hi> 161. where he ſays he took this way to right himſelf, becauſe of the Scots here in Town being on his Top, and of ſome other harſh uſage which he receiv'd at the hands of the Scots Company.</p>
                  <p>The very manner of giving in his Evidence lays him open to the Laſh of the Engliſh Law; and it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd that his train of Blaſphemies, and conſtant ridiculing the Text, would have been taken notice of e're now by a certain Court at the Weſt end of <hi>Paul's,</hi> but that he is protected by ſome Gentlemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a Court at the Weſt end of the Town.</p>
                  <p>His invenom'd malice is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by the ſport he makes to himſelf throughout his Libel at the Calamities and Miſery of his Fellow-Creatures and Countrymen; ſo that never did any man more exactly fill up the Character
<pb facs="tcp:45975:60"/>of a Renegado than himſelf: for as thoſe Miſcreants ſtab an Image of our Saviour to the Heart, as a proof of having abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denied him; <hi>H—s</hi> hath in the ſame manner done all he could to ſtab the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his native Country, as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain evidence of his being turn'd a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in Nature; for which even they that imploy him muſt needs abhor him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they love to ſee the Image of their own Crimes in his Lovely Features.</p>
                  <p>We have not enter'd upon the detail of his malicious Lies with which he hath ſtuff'd his Book, but have only pointed at the chief of them which are ſo very noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as may well put his Suborners to the Bluſh, that they ſhould not have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught him his Leſſon better, or have ſeen he had conn'd it more exactly; for they are ſuch groſs Contradictions either to common Senſe or to what he himſelf has advanc'd in his Libel, that none but one who had ſwallow'd Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation could be guilty of the like.</p>
                  <p>It's needleſs to enlarge upon his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſince it's impoſſible to conceive
<pb facs="tcp:45975:60"/>a worſe Idea of him than all Men of Senſe will immediately form to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they know he is a Traitor to his Country.</p>
                  <p>He was was formerly a Surgeon in the Fleet, and made ſome Intereſt amongſt the Officers, by Female Mediation, which was allow'd him by his laſt Religion (for his Book ſhews that now he has none.) Hence it is, that he expreſſes himſelf ſo readily in the Dialect of his Office, and talks of <hi>Bullying</hi> Kings in his Dedication, to ſhew us that he was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with B-dy-houſe Rhetorick, and they that know his Friends in <hi>Little—B—n,</hi> ſay he has convey'd his Libel to the World through a very proper Channel.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt he was a Surgeon in the Fleet, his ill Nature having condemn'd him to perpetual Broyls, he had the Impudence to draw upon his Captain aſhore, who wounded him ſo as 'twas thought might have put a period to his Infamous Life, upon which his Captain was Confin'd, but the Wound not being Mortal, the Gentleman was ſet at Liberty, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on Board, a Council of War was held, by which <hi>H—s</hi> was like to have had an Exit more anſwerable to his deſert, at the Yard-Arm; but that one of our Country-men who Commanded in the Place, ſav'd him out of Pity, and whilſt he was ſculking at <hi>London</hi> to avoid this Proſecution; others of them out of
<pb facs="tcp:45975:61"/>Compaſſion hir'd him to go along with their Fleet, for which he hath made his Country ſuch a Grateful Reward, as hath verify'd the Proverb, <hi>That ſave a R—gue from the Gallows he ſhall be the firſt that will cut your Throat.</hi> We leave his Suborners to think on't.</p>
                  <p>His Captain being thus diſappointed of having Juſtice executed, was forc'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with <hi>Pricking him Run,</hi> that he might not have any claim to his Wages; but ſince his return from <hi>Darien,</hi> and engaging in the Honourable ſervice of Reviling and Belying his Country, his Suborners out of their innate Bounty and Gratitude, have got him deliver'd from all farther Proſecution, entitled him to his Wages, and given him the opportunity to value himſelf upon his Coreſpondence at the Court end of the Town, ſo that now he thinks himſelf ſure of a Patent for Life, and that he ſhall never be oblig'd to go up <hi>Holborn</hi>-Hill except his important occaſions call him now and then that way, to enable him to pay his preſent Debts, when ſome of his Brethren, paſs that Road to pay their laſt.</p>
                  <p>It had been eaſie for us to have given ſuch a Hiſtory of his Life as would have put his Suborners to the bluſh, but we reſerve that to make uſe of as we ſhall ſee occaſion; what's ſaid is enough to let them know how much they are to truſt to his Evidence, if they think fit to make further uſe of him, either by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling his Country, or accuſing any of thoſe great Families he threatens in his Dedication.</p>

                  <head>AN INQUIRY INTO The Cauſes of the Miſcariage of the <hi>Scots</hi> Colony at <hi>Darien.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE main deſign of <hi>H—s</hi> and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orners, is to charge the Miſcarriage of the <hi>Scots</hi> Colony upon their own Country, to clear ſome Gentlemen that perhaps may be found within the Verge of <hi>White-Hall,</hi> from having any hand in it, and to evince the neceſſity of thoſe Proclamations publiſh'd againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> ſo as no Perſon or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>England</hi> may ſeem juſtly chargeable with the ruin of that Colony; a certain Evidence that the Crime is very black, and that they are put to a miſerable ſhift, when thoſe Gentlemen are at ſuch expence of Contrivance and Pains to wipe off the Imputation, and ſo ready to fall in with any Tool that they think can aſſiſt them in ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>Enough has been ſaid already to demonſtrate that the evidence of ſuch an infamous Perſon as <hi>H—s,</hi> and ſo circumſtantiated, would not be admitted in any Court of Judicature in <hi>Europe,</hi> eſpecially againſt ſuch an honourable Society as the Company of <hi>Scotland</hi> for trading to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> which conſiſts of the very flower of the Nation, and perhaps has more Perſons of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45975:62"/>Birth, Quality and Merit in it, than any trading Company that ever yet was erected in the World. The Directors particularly, whom <hi>H—s</hi> and his Maſters have condemned to the Halter, <hi>p.</hi> 46. are moſt of them Perſons of that Quality, Eſtate, Worth, and untainted Honour, as the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of no one particular Perſon, tho of never ſo good Repute, could in juſtice or decency be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt them, and much leſs the malicious Calumnies of a Renegado.</p>
                  <p>But to ſet this matter in a clearer Light: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we have only <hi>H—s</hi>'s own word for what he aſſerts in vindication of his Friends and Suborners; we ſhall demonſtrate againſt him and them too from undeniable matter of Fact, that ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>England</hi> are juſtly chargeable with the ruin of that Colony.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall begin with the oppoſition made to the <hi>Scots</hi> Act by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> (to whom the matter was miſrepreſented) the Anſwer they obtain'd from the King, and the Proſecution they commenc'd and threatned againſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Natives, and <hi>Scots-men</hi> reſiding in <hi>England,</hi> that ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the <hi>Scots</hi> Company.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we alledg the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reſident's Memorial at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> againſt that Governments ſuffering any of their Subjects to ſubſcribe to the <hi>Scots</hi> Company.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe well enough known that the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Example of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court hinder'd the Subſcriptions of our Neighbours in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor can it be denied but this continued Thread of Oppoſition from the Court of <hi>England,</hi> muſt needs hinder the Subſcriptions of a great many in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who could not but foreſee that a Storm was threatned by ſo many Clouds.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45975:62"/>
                  <p>To this we may add, that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> have not yet forgot the diſcourting of the Marquiſs of <hi>Tweddale</hi> (who was known to be an able Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a true Patriot to his Country) becauſe of his touching that Act, when he had the Honor to repreſent his Majeſty on the Throne.</p>
                  <p>Nor was it the leaſt of our Misfortunes, that we loſt ſuch an able and faithful Miniſter of State as Secretary <hi>Johnſton,</hi> and that too upon the account of his Affection to his Country in this matter. We are very well ſatisfied that his Majeſty, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd him to that Poſt for his Merit, and was ſo well ſatisfied with his ability and care, would ſcarcely have parted with a Miniſter of that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Faithfulneſs and Penetration, but by the Intrigues of ſome People at Court.</p>
                  <p>Before we proceed any further with the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Oppoſition made to us, we ſhall obviate one Objection which ſome Perſons may poſſibly make, <hi>viz.</hi> That all we have ſaid hitherto is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, becauſe it does not regard our Colony, but the Company. To which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: 1. That this is ſo far from being an Excuſe to our Oppoſers, that it highly aggravates our Charge againſt them, as being a plain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they were reſolv'd to obſtruct our Trade in every reſpect, and whatever it ſhould be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exception. 2. That the oppoſing of the Company was the direct Method to prevent our ever having a Colony; and by the Laws of God and Man, thoſe who endeavour to deſtroy the <hi>Embrio,</hi> are chargeable with a deſign of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Birth. But we ſhall come cloſer to the point in a little time, and reſume the thread of our Narrative after one or two Obſervations upon what we have ſaid already, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45975:63"/>
                     <item>(1.) That the greateſt of thoſe Difficulties and Diſappointments which <hi>H—s</hi> ſays in his Book, the Company met with as to their Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Payments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may juſtly be charg'd to the account of that oppoſition made us from the Court of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>(2.) That there is ſo little reaſon to upbraid us, that our Efforts were not greater, that it is rather to be wonder'd at that the Company was not daſh'd to pieces and cruſh'd in the bud; and much more that ever they ſhould have been able to weather out the Storm of ſo much Indignation, overcome all thoſe Difficulties, find Mony enough to build Ships, equip out a Fleet, and make a Settlement in <hi>America</hi> when neither <hi>England,</hi> nor <hi>Scots-men</hi> reſiding there, <hi>Hamburgh</hi> nor <hi>Holland,</hi> ſhall dare to aſſiſt them without incurring his Majeſty of <hi>England</hi>'s diſpleaſure.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>But to come directly to the Narrative of the Oppoſition made to our Colony. It is well enough known that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as many other Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> have ſuffered much for three or four years paſt by bad. Harveſts, which rendred them uncapable of providing Bread for their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at home, and much more of ſending Supplies to their Infant Colony abroad: This was very manifeſt to ſome People about <hi>White-hall,</hi> and care was taken we ſhould have none for our Mony from <hi>England,</hi> tho that Nation could have ſpar'd it, and perhaps we might have pleaded it as our merit, when in Parliament we voted his Majeſty a ſtanding Army, upon his Royal Word that it was neceſſary, tho we had more need to have ſav'd the Mony to have bought Bread for thouſands of our People that were ſtarving for want, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us the melancholy proſpect of dying by ſhoals in our Streets, and have left behind them a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45975:63"/>reigning Contagion, which hath ſwept away multitudes more, and God knows where it may end.</p>
                  <p>Tho our Country was reduced to this deplorable ſtate, that a generous Enemy would have ſhew'd us compaſſion, yet the malice of our Court Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries did not reſt here, nor with having follow'd us into <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> but purſues us into <hi>America;</hi> and with Angry Proclamations forbids the Subjects there, on pain of his Majeſty's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, to afford any manner of aſſiſtance to the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Darien:</hi> So that we are ſtarv'd at home and abroad by our Enemies at Court, who having by this means diſpoſſeſs'd us of our Colony at <hi>Darien,</hi> and knowing that the good People of <hi>England</hi> had reaſon to cry ſhame upon them, and might perhaps take their own time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this inhuman Treatment of their Neighbours in <hi>Scotland;</hi> therefore they found it neceſſary to ſuppreſs a Book wrote in defence of the <hi>Scots</hi> Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, and to hire a <hi>Scots</hi> Renegado Surgeon to varniſh over the matter, and to repreſent his Countrymen as Knaves and Fools, that ſo they might fall unpitied.</p>
                  <p>To return again to the Oppoſition made us in <hi>America:</hi> It is not enough that we are ſtarv'd out of <hi>Darien,</hi> but when we come from thence, and ſo leave what the Proclamations ſuppoſe to be <hi>the Dominions of their Allies,</hi> yet we muſt not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, nor have Proviſions in exchange for our effects, tho our Men be dying for want, on pain of incurring the Diſpleaſure of the Court; and therefore thoſe who are willing to relieve us, muſt put their Inventions on the rack to ſind out a way to do that with ſafety, which common Humanity, and much more Chriſtianity, obliges them to do to a Turk or a Jew in the like circumſtances.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45975:64"/>
                  <p>Nay farther, tho notwithſtanding our diſtreſs at home, we make ſhift to ſend a Convoy to our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony abroad, becauſe our future hopes depended ſo much upon it, they ſhall not have leave to put in to any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Port to refit, refreſh, or ſtay for any of their Company that may be ſeparated from them by ſtorm; and yet our Friends who were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in obtaining and publiſhing thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, muſt bribe a Renegado to declare to the World in print, that they were no way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Blood of his Country-men that were ſtarv'd to death at <hi>Darien.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will appear plain that the Ruin of the Colony is chargeable on the Proclamations, if we conſider the Conſternation that muſt needs be among them when they ſaw themſelves condemned, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invaded the Dominions of his Majeſty's Allies; ſo that they had all the reaſon in the World to think that they were not only precluded from all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of having any further ſupply or aſſiſtance from home, but in danger of being attack'd by his Fleet, as they that advis'd the emitting of thoſe Proclamations muſt needs think his Majeſty was oblig'd in Honour and Juſtice to order, if he was of opinion that the <hi>Scots</hi> had broken the Alliance betwixt him and <hi>Spain.</hi> Let any reaſonable man conſider what Anguiſh and Perplexity theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, join'd to their pinching Wants and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances, muſt occaſion in the minds of thoſe poor men, and whether it might not give a handle to thoſe of them that were unwilling to ſtay, to mutiny againſt the reſt, and put all into diſorder, which might be fomented by other ill perſons amongſt them; for we are not to ſuppoſe that with 11 or 1200 men, there went no other ill man but <hi>H—s,</hi> ſince it's not improbable that they who oppoſed our Company ſo much from the very
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45975:64"/>beginning, might be prompted by the ſame Malice to ſend Spies and Traitors amongſt our Men on purpoſe to defeat their Deſign.</p>
                  <p>If it had not been that they were thus diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and brought to their wits-end by thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, they would certainly have had ſo much Conduct as to have ſent away a great part of their Men to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> or any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, where they might have ſubſiſted till the arrival of a Convoy from <hi>Scotland;</hi> and ſo with thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions that were ſufficient to carry them as far as <hi>New York,</hi> and a great deal further if they had not been retarded by Tempeſts, might have maintain'd a competent number of their Men to keep poſſeſſion of the Colony till Supplies had arriv'd: but the Proclamations diſabled them from taking this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and by conſequence are chargeable with the ruin of the Colony.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, it is undeniable that thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations muſt needs have incouraged the <hi>Spain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and other Enemies in their Oppoſition againſt our Colony, and animated them to go on with their Preparations to drive us out. So that had they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted upon no other account but the noiſe of the great Preparations making againſt them by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Carthagena, Porto Bello,</hi> &amp;c, as Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Beeſton</hi> ſeem'd to inſinuate in his Letter; it makes the Proclamations directly chargeable with the Ruin of the Colony, ſince they had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to remove from thence when their own Prince had forbid all Commerce with them, and when their Enemies were making formidable Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt them.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe plain that thoſe Proclamations muſt neceſſarily prevent their having any Supplies from the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Curaſſaw,</hi> if they had any to ſpare: for ſince the Influence of ours and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Court
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45975:65"/>prevented our Company's having any Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Holland,</hi> it is reaſonable to believe it would have the ſame influence in reference to our Colony, in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plantations.</p>
                  <p>We have likewiſe all the reaſon in the world to conclude, that the Influence of thoſe Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might hinder the Natives from giving our Colony thoſe Supplies that it was in their power to have done; for there's no doubt but they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of 'em induſtriouſly ſent them by ſome of our Adverſaries, when Capt. <hi>Long</hi> was ſo malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to endeavour at our firſt arrival to poſſeſs them with an opinion that we were nothing but Pirats, and that the K. of <hi>Great Britain</hi> would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own us; and indeed by the event it would ſeem he had Inſtructions ſo to do. It is true that at firſt the Natives ſeeing our Men have a Competency of all ſorts of Proviſions, might not believe his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; but they muſt needs have been confirm'd in the truth of it afterwards, when they ſaw them dying for want, and deceiv'd as to their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of further Supplies; and upon that account might think they had ſufficient ground to withdraw their Aſſiſtance from them, and not further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in favour of a People that they found were not able to do any thing for themſelves, and by conſequence uncapable to protect them, which was the thing they were to expect from their Alliance.</p>
                  <p>Having thus made it evident that the Oppoſition our Company met with from Court at firſt, and the Proclamations iſſued againſt our Colony at laſt, are juſtly to be reputed among the principal Cauſes of the Miſcarriage of that Deſign, we come in the next place to conſider his Majeſty's Anſwer to the Addreſs of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> on that Head, and the Proclamations iſſued out againſt us in his Name in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45975:65"/>
                  <p>We are ſorry that ever there ſhould have been any occaſion for ſuch an ungrateful piece of work; but think it a Duty incumbent upon us, and what we owe to the Conſtitution of our Country, which we have reaſon to believe is induſtriouſly conceal'd from his Majeſty, to write freely on this head, that the World may ſee what juſt cauſe we have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty's Anſwer, <hi>That he had been ill ſerv'd in</hi> Scotland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſuch, as our Anceſtors (if we may believe our Hiſtorians) would have thought inconſiſtent with the Truſt repoſed in a King of <hi>Scots,</hi> a manifeſt Reflection upon the Juſtice and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of the Nation, and a diſcovery of their <hi>Arcana Imperii</hi> to thoſe that were quarrelling with them. We are not to ſuppoſe that his Majeſty would give an Anſwer to an Addreſs of this Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance without Counſel: If he conſulted with our <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Oppoſers, it was the ſame as if he had conſulted our profeſſed Enemies; if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with <hi>Scots</hi>-men, and was advis'd to this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by any of them, they are Traitors to their Country, and have betray'd its Soveraignty: for they ought to have advis'd him to anſwer, that as King of <hi>Scots</hi> he was not to give an account to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for any thing tranſacted in that Kingdom; but if they found themſelves any ways aggrivev'd, or thought their Trade endanger'd by the <hi>Scots</hi> Act, he ſhould be willing to have the matter debated and adjuſted by Commiſſioners of both Nations, as became the Common Father of both. This could not juſtly have been look'd upon by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> as a refractory or ſtubborn Anſwer, but muſt have been imputed to his braveneſs of Temper, and fidelity to his Truſt. But at once to give up the Soveraignty of <hi>Scotland,</hi> without demurring upon it, argues that his Majeſty was advis'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45975:66"/>to this Anſwer by Enemies to the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>Our Parliaments have originally a greater Power than that of <hi>England;</hi> for what the States of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> offer'd to the touch of the Scepter, their Kings had no power to refuſe; or if they did, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves of the States had the force of a Law not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding. Thus our Reformation was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1560, by an Act of the States; and tho our Queen <hi>Mary</hi> then in <hi>France,</hi> and her Husband the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> afterwards <hi>Francis</hi> I. refus'd to give their Conſent, it remain'd a firm Law; which Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> when ſhe return'd to <hi>Scotland,</hi> was ſo far from offering to diſpenſe with, tho ſhe was a great Aſſerter of her Prerogative, that ſhe was oblig'd to intreat of the States ſo far to diſpenſe with it themſelves, as to ſuffer her to have Maſs in her own Family. We might go farther back to the Reign of <hi>Robert</hi> II. who was check'd by the States for making a Truce with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> without their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it not being then in the power of our Kings either to make Peace or War without the States. But the Truth of that Maxim laid down by our Hiſtorian, <hi>That the ſupreme Power of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Scotland <hi>is in the States,</hi> is ſo obvious to every one that reads our Hiſtory, that it cannot be denied; and hence it is that our old Acts of Parliament are often call'd <hi>the Acts of the States,</hi> and ſay, <hi>The three States enact,</hi> &amp;c. for by our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Conſtitution the King is none of the States, but only <hi>Dux belli,</hi> and <hi>Miniſter publicus;</hi> which was well underſtood by our Viceroy the E. of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and the other Deputies from the States of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when they acquainted Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in their Memorial, That <hi>the</hi> Scots <hi>created their Kings on that condition, that they might, when they ſaw cauſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them of that Power which they receiv'd from the People,</hi> which we have now reaſſerted in making
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45975:66"/>
                     <hi>our Crown forfeitable by the Claim of Right at the laſt Revolution:</hi> and perhaps that's none of the leaſt Cauſes why our Ruin is now endeavour'd by the Abettors of a growing Prerogative.</p>
                  <p>It were eaſy for us to enlarge on this, and to ſhew from our Hiſtories and Acts of Parliaments, that our Kings, according to our antient Conſtitution (which thoſe Rapes committed on our Liberties in ſome of the laſt Reigns can never overturn) were inferior to their Parliaments, who inthron'd and dethron'd them as they ſaw cauſe, made them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for their Adminiſtration, allow'd them no power of proroguing them without their own conſent, nor of hindering their meeting when the <hi>ardua Regni negotia</hi> requir'd it. They could not make Peace or War without them, nor ſo much as diſpoſe of their Caſtles, but by their Conſent. Their Councils were choſen and ſworn in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and puniſhable by the States: Nor had they any Revenue, but what their Parliaments allow'd them. Theſe and many more were the native Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> an 1638. and their Repreſentation of their Proceedings againſt the Miſtakes in the King's Declaration in 1640. And therefore his Majeſty had no reaſon to ſay he was ill ſerv'd by the paſſing of an Act offer'd by the States of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ignorance of thoſe things have often occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fion'd our being miſrepreſented by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, and other Writers, as Rebels, and what not, when we really acted according to our own fundamental Laws. And not only they, but even our own Princes ſince the Union of the Crowns, have either been kept ignorant of our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſo incens'd againſt it by the Abettors of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45975:67"/>Tyranny, that they have all of 'em, his preſent Majeſty excepted, endeavour'd our Overthrow, as well knowing it to be impoſſible to bring Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government to perfection, whilſt a People who had always breath'd in a free Air, and call'd their Princes to an account when they invaded their Properties, were in any condition to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or aſſiſt others againſt ſuch Princes as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd an abſolute Sway. But the Pill being too bitter to be ſwallowed by it ſelf, there was a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of taking Prieſtcraft into the Compoſition, and to gild it over with the ſpecious pretext of bringing the <hi>Scots</hi> to an Uniformity in Religion. The Court knew that this would arm the Zealots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and that it could never be aflected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ruin of our Kingdom, whoſe Religion was ſo interwoven with our Civil Conſtitution, that there was no overturning of the one, without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the other. This will appear plain to thoſe that know, that beſides the Sanction of Acts of Parliament, the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is defended by a full Repreſentative of the Clergy and Laity of the Kingdom call'd a General Aſſembly (which preſerves us from being Prieſt-ridden, as our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments do from being Prince-ridden) where the King by Law had no negative Voice, no more than he formerly had in our Parliaments. This in effect is the Repreſentative of the Nation as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as the Parliaments are our Repreſentatives as Men; and as to the Laity, many of them are the ſame individual Perſons that ſit in Parliament. So that thoſe Aſſemblies being a ſecond Barrier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Liberties, it was thought ſit to run down the Conſtitution of our Church, as not ſuted with Monarchy. The Caſe being thus, we dare refer it to the thoughts of our neighbouring Nation, who have gallantly from time to time ſtood up for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45975:67"/>their own Liberties, whether it were not more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous for them to unite with us than to ſuffer us to be oppreſs'd and enſlav'd.</p>
                  <p>There's nothing can be objected to this, but that all theſe glorious Privileges were ſwallow'd up by thoſe Acts of Parliament that exalted the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative to ſuch a height in the Reign of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. To which we anſwer, That the Privileges of a Nation cannot be giv'n away without their own conſent; and we are morally certain, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents even of thoſe pack'd Parliaments did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give any commiſſion to thoſe that repreſented them, to give away thoſe Liberties. Slavery is repugnant to human Nature; ſo that it cannot be ſuppoſed the Nation exalted the Prerogative on purpoſe to put themſelves in a worſe condition than beſore, or that when they find it applied to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe than that which they gave it for, they may not reduce it to its antient Boundary. The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Affairs did ſometimes oblige the <hi>Romans</hi> to entruſt their Dictators with an extraordinary and abſolute Power; but when the occaſion ceas'd, they recalled it, and kept to their antient and rational Maxim, that <hi>Salus Populi</hi> is <hi>ſuprema Lex.</hi> In the like manner the Enemies of our old Conſtitution may know, if they pleaſe, that we have retrieved the main point of making our Crown forfeitable by the Claim of Right; and therefore if they puſh us too far, it's a thouſand to one but we may renew our Demands to the reſt, or oblige them to caſt them into the bargain.</p>
                  <p>But to return from this Digreſſion. Tho we had no ſuch peculiar Privileges belonging to us; why might not we expect that his majeſty ſhould be as kind to us as to our Brethren in <hi>England?</hi> He hath once and again declared to them in Parliament, <hi>That he never had, nor never will have an Intereſt. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45975:68"/>from that of his People.</hi> Then why ſhould not the Intereſt of the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> be the ſame with the Intereſt of the King of <hi>Scots?</hi> And if the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> met in Parliament, agreed upon it as their Intereſt to have that Act paſt for incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Kieir Trade, how was it poſſible that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> could be <hi>ill ſerv'd</hi> by the paſſing that Act in <hi>Scotland?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Enemies, and <hi>H—s</hi>'s Suborners have put a ſort of an Anſwer to this in his mouth, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſaid Act was obtain'd <hi>viis &amp; modis;</hi> but the Falſhood and Malice of that Inſinuation will appear to the World by the previous Act of 1693. for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of foreign Trade, by which it was ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, <q>That Merchants more or fewer may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and enter into ſuch Societies and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for carrying on Trade, as to any Subject of Goods or Merchandiſe, to whatſomever King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Countries, or parts of the World, not being in War with his Majeſty, where Trade is in uſe to be or may be follow'd; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beſides the Kingdoms and Countries of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> to the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the <hi>Straits,</hi> and to trade in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> or upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> or elſewhere, as above. Which So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and Companies being contracted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into upon the terms, and in the uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ſuch Companies are ſet up—His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with Conſent aforeſaid did allow and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, giving and granting to them and each of them, all Powers, Rights and Privileges, as to their Perſons, Rules and Orders, that by the Laws are given to Companies allowed to be erected for Manufactories: And his Majeſty for their greater Incouragement, did promiſe to give to thoſe Companies, and each of them, his Letters Patent under the Great Seal, confirming
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45975:68"/>to them the whole foreſaid Powers and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, with what other incouragement his Majeſty ſhould judg needful.</q> Theſe are the very terms of the Act of 1693. and in purſuance of this Act our Nation being willing to form a Company for trading to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> this Act which hath met with ſo much oppoſition in the World, was paſt <hi>June</hi> 26. 1695. which was two years after. Then with what Effrontery can <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborners ſuggeſt, that it was obtain'd <hi>viis &amp; modis,</hi> by ſurpriſe or in a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitious manner? But ſomething they muſt ſay to juſtify their unreaſonable treatment of us, and to blind the Eyes of the World.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee then that the Parliament of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> went on deliberately to advance their Trade, and to make this Act: by which it's evident that they who advis'd his Majeſty to ſay that he was <hi>ill ſerv'd in</hi> Scotland, impos'd upon him, have laid a Foundation of diviſion betwixt him and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which are the two conſtituent parts of our Government; and if they be daſh'd againſt one another, the whole frame of it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be diſſolv'd. Hence alſo it is evident that thoſe Counſellors, if <hi>Scots-men,</hi> ought by our old Conſtitution to be call'd to an account by the Parliament according to the 12th Act of Parl. 2 <hi>James</hi> 4. And if they be Engliſhmen or Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we have a right to demand Juſtice againſt them, as having meddled in our Affairs contrary to the Laws of Nations.</p>
                  <p>The Soveraignty of our Nation, and the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of the K. of <hi>Scots</hi> upon the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> being tacitely giv'n up by this Anſwer; and the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> being poſſeſs'd by our Enemies with a falſe. Notion of our Deſign, they put a ſtop to our taking Subſcriptions from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45975:69"/>any Reſidenters in <hi>England;</hi> tho our offering to take in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as Sharers, was a plain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the uprightneſs of our Intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Nation. This made it apparent, that we had no deſign in the leaſt to ſupplant them in their Trade, but on the contrary to make them Partakers in ours, in order to lay a foundation for a cloſer Union, and greater Amity betwixt the two Nations; which if it had taken effect, our Trade had not been nipp'd in the bud, as now it is by the frowns of the Court, but might by this time have been improv'd to the advancement of the glory and ſtrength of the Iſland: Whereas by the oppoſition made to that noble Deſign, the Nations are more alienated from one another than before, leſſen'd in their Strength and Trade, and <hi>Scotland</hi> for ever loſt as to their Friendſhip, uſefulneſs, and joining with <hi>England</hi> on any occaſion whatever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs proper Meaſures be taken to make up the Breach, and retrieve our loſt Honour and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                  <p>All that can be ſaid to excuſe ſo falſe a ſtep in ſuch a wiſe Nation as <hi>England,</hi> is, that they were impos'd upon by thoſe that are Enemies to the true Liberties of both Nations, and by ſome of their Traders and ignorant Pretenders, to give advice in matters of Trade, who out of a ſordid Principle of Self-intereſt, preferr'd their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gain to the general advantage of their Country. This would have quickly been ſeen, had his Majeſty and the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> inſtead of that violent oppoſition which they made to the <hi>Scots</hi> Act, deſir'd a conference betwixt a Committee of the Parliaments of both Nations; then it would ſoon have appear'd what our true Deſign was, and that it was neither our Intereſt nor Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion immediately to follow an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45975:69"/>the apprehenſions of which did ſo much alarm the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> That it was not our Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is evident from our rejecting the Propoſals of our Countryman Mr. <hi>Douglas,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Merchant, with which <hi>H—s</hi> upbraids us, by which at the ſame time he diſcovers his own folly and diſhoneſty; his Folly in arguing againſt the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> which he pretends to eſpouſe; and his Diſhoneſty in propoſing our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a Trade, which his new Maſters (who have paid him ſo well for his falſe Evidence) look upon to be deſtructive to theirs.</p>
                  <p>That it was not our Intereſt immediately to think of an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade is evident from this, that it would have exported our Mony with which it's known we do not abound, and ruin'd the Linen Manufacture of our Country, upon which ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Poor depend. This we think the City of <hi>London</hi> may be ſenſible of in a good meaſure, by the multitudes of their own Silk-Weavers, that are ſtarv'd for want of Imployment; and alſo by the unſucceſsfulneſs of their own Linen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture in <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of the great quantity of Silks, Muſlins, Calicoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> brought from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi> from whence ſome wiſe Men have been and are ſtill of opinion, that an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade of that ſort tends to the general Impoveriſhment of <hi>Europe,</hi> tho it may enrich particular Perſons. Theſe Conſiderations, together with ſome Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that Mr. <hi>Douglas</hi> might have been put upon making us that Propoſal, on purpoſe to divert us from our other Deſign of an <hi>American</hi> Trade, were the true Reaſons of our not hearkening to Mr. <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Advice. This our Neighbours might have known, had they proceeded with us in ſuch a Friendly manner as we had reaſon to expect, when we were ſo kind as to offer them a ſhare
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45975:70"/>in the Benefits of our Act. And the Government at the ſame time might ſoon have been ſatisfied, that the ſinking of their Cuſtoms by our own and twenty years Freedom from that Duty, was a meer bugbear Pretence. It is evident that we could not have ſpent much <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore muſt have exported them. If we had brought them to <hi>England,</hi> they were liable to Cuſtoms there. If we had offer'd to run them over the Border, they could as well have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented that, as the ſtealing over their own Corn and Wool: and if we had exported them to any other places of <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by their Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs could have done it in effect as cheap as we. By all which it appears, that there was no ſolid Foundation for any of thoſe pretended Reaſons, why the Government in particular, or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in general, ſhould have oppos'd us: and we wiſh that upon due inquiry it may not be found to be the effect of Dutch Councils; for that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being jealous of their Trade, and Rivals to <hi>England</hi> on that account, cannot be ſuppos'd to have ſat ſtill and done nothing, when they ſaw we had obtain'd ſuch an Act, and were reſolv'd to take in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to partake in our Trade, which if ſuffer'd to go on, might endanger theirs, and enable the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to outrival them indeed, beſides the preſent loſs they foreſaw of our Cuſtom, the <hi>Scots</hi> having moſt of their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods from <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This we have the more reaſon to ſuſpect, firſt becauſe tho the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have formerly ſuffered in their Trade by the Incroachments and Intrigues of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but never by the <hi>Scots;</hi> yet they have made no Application to his Majeſty, for preventing the like in time to come. If it be ſaid that be is but Stadtholder there, whereas he is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45975:70"/>K. of <hi>Scots:</hi> We can eaſily reply, that it appears: by what has been ſaid already of our true Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> were as much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to the States of that Nation as the Dutch Stadtholder is to the States of <hi>Holland.</hi> The 2 <hi>d</hi> Reaſon we have to ſuſpect the Influence of Dutch Councils in this Affair, is this, that 'tis their Intereſt to keep us and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from uniting, and if poſſible of forcing us by that means into an Alliance with themſelves, to prevent their own ruin, if <hi>England</hi> after this ſhould come to fall out with them upon the account of Trade or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and likewiſe to have their Privilege of fiſhing in our Seas continued, which they know to be of ſuch vaſt Advantage to them, that they are ſhrewdly ſuſpected of having by Bribes, or other indirect Methods, prevail'd with ſome great Men, to ſupplant us as to the Benefits we had juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect from the Act of 1661. incouraging our Fiſhery; the Privileges granted by which, are very conſiderable, and to continue for ever: nay to put it out of all doubt that they are join'd in this matter againſt us, <hi>H—s</hi> owns it as beforemention'd.</p>
                  <p>Being upon this Subject, we cannot but take notice of the difference betwixt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials about <hi>Darien,</hi> and of thoſe late Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als preſented by them to our Court againſt their meddling with the Succeſſion of that Monarchy, or the cantoning it out into ſeveral Parcels in caſe the King of <hi>Spain</hi> die without Iſſue. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, tho inſolent and huſſing enough, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by our Court, therefore calmly digeſted; and the deſire of them effectually anſwer'd, to the ruin almoſt of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation: but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was no ſooner preſented, than the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45975:71"/>are diſgrac'd in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and forbid both Courts.</p>
                  <p>It may therefore deſerve the Inquiry of our Neighbours, what this Regulation about the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the diſmembring of their Monarchy is, that occaſion ſuch outragious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials: for there muſt needs be ſomething in it that touches the <hi>Spaniards</hi> more ſenſibly than the buſineſs of <hi>Darien,</hi> and which they did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of till they were put upon it; and in like manner touches our court more ſenſibly to the quick than any Memorials about that Affair, tho they had not been of their own procurement, were capable of doing. Perhaps upon a narrow Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny into this Affair it will be found, that this keen and uninterrupted Oppoſition made to the <hi>Scots</hi> Settlement at <hi>Darien,</hi> does not proceed from any foreſight of damage that it could do to the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> tho that be the ſpecious Pretext, but from a Cauſe which touches ſome People more nearly, croſſes their Project of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, and of having that important Poſt to their own ſhare; they know that they have a natural, as well as a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Intereſt in ſome great Courtiers, and make little doubt of obtaining the preheminence before either of thoſe Nations that compoſe the Empire of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> It concerns our Neighbours ſo much the more to inquire into this, becauſe it is viſible from the Reſentments of it by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court, that this matter is more like to affect the advantageous Trade that <hi>England</hi> drives with <hi>Spain,</hi> than our Settlement in <hi>America</hi> was ever like to do; which tho it be made a Sacrifice to his Catholick Majeſty, and perhaps on purpoſe to make him digeſt the other Project with more
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45975:71"/>eaſe, is like to be of as little advantage to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as was the Sacrifice of the great Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raleigh</hi> formerly, tho it may be infinitely more to their damage. If our Neighbours have a mind to be fully inform'd of this matter, they know who were imploy'd in thoſe Negotiations, and how to ſpeak with them.</p>
                  <p>We come next to conſider the Oppoſition made to our Subſcriptions at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> by Sir <hi>Paul Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caut</hi> the Engliſh Reſident there, in conjunction with his Majeſty's Envoy to the Court of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburg,</hi> who deliver'd in a joint Memorial to the Senate of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> threatning them with the heighth of his Majeſty's Diſpleaſure, if they join'd with the <hi>Scots</hi> in any Treaty of Commerce what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. This we ſhall not need to make any Reflexions upon, the Petitions from the Company to his Majeſty and his Privy Council in <hi>Scotland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient for that end.</p>

                              <p>And for the better enabling us to accompliſh the ends of Your Majeſty's ſaid Act of Parliament, and Letters Patent, we have purſuant thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to appointed certain Deputies of our own num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to tranſact and negotiate our neceſſary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45975:72"/>beyond Sea, and at the ſame time to treat with ſuch Foreigners of any Nation in amity with Your Majeſty, as might be inclinable to join with us for the purpoſe aforeſaid. In the proſecution of which Commiſſion to our ſaid Deputies, veſted with full Power and Authority according to Law, We are not a little ſurprized to find, to the great hindrance and obſtruction of our Affairs, That your Majeſty's Envoy to the Courts of <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> and Reſident at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> have under pretence of ſpecial Warrant from Your Majeſty, given in a joint ſubſcribed Memorial to the Senat of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> expreſly invading the Privileges granted to our Company by Your Majeſty's ſaid Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent, as by the herewith tranſmitted Copy may appear.</p>
                              <p>By the which Memorial we ſuſtain great and manifold Prejudices, ſince both the Senat and Inhabitants of the ſaid City of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> are thereby, contrary to the Law of Nations, expreſly threatned with Your Majeſty's Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if they or either of them ſhould counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or join with us in any Treaty of Trade or Commerce whatſoever, which deprives us of the aſſiſtance which we had reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from ſeveral Inhabitants of that City.</p>
                              <p>For redreſs whereof we do in all Duty and Humility apply to Your Majeſty, not only for the Protection and Maintenance of our Privileges and freedom of Trade, but alſo for reparation of damage conform to Your Majeſty's ſaid Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent. And we further beg leave humbly to repreſent to Your Majeſty, that tho by the ſaid Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent, we conceive our ſelves legally and ſufficiently authorized to treat even with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45975:73"/>any Soveraign Potentate or State in Amity with Your Majeſty for the ſupport and advancement of our Trade; yet we by our ſaid Deputies have only treated with particular and private Merchants of the ſaid City of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever making any the leaſt Propoſal to the Senate thereof: and this we humbly conceive to be the natural Right and Privilege of all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants whatſoever, even tho we had wanted the Sanction of ſo ſolemn Laws; and without ſome ſpeedy redreſs be had therein, not only this Company, but all the individual Merchants of this Kingdom, muſt from henceforward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all our Rights and Freedoms of Trade are and may be further by our Neighbours vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently wreſted out of our hands.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45975:74"/>whatſoever, but have alſo had all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hopes and proſpect of foreign Aid that our hearts could wiſh, till (to our great ſurprize) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> have, under pretence of ſpecial Warrant from his Majeſty, put a ſtop thereto, by giving in a Memorial to the Senat of that City, threatning both Senat and Inhabitants with the King's utmoſt Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if they ſhould countenance or join with us in any Treaty of Trade or Commerce, as by the annexed Copy thereof may appear.</p>
                              <p>Upon due conſideration whereof, we have in all duty and humility addreſſed his Majeſty in <hi>June</hi> laſt for redreſs thereof; in anſwer to which Addreſs his Majeſty was then graciouſly pleaſed to ſignify by his Royal Letter, That upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England</hi> he would take into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Contents of our ſaid Addreſs, and that in the mean time he would give Orders to the ſaid Miniſters at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> not to make uſe of his Royal Name or Authority for obſtructing the Trade of our Company with the Inhabitants of that City. In the full aſſurance of which we reſted ſecure, and took our meaſures according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till to our further ſurprize and unſpeakable prejudice, we find by repeated Advices from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> that the ſaid Reſident continues ſtill contumacious; and is ſo far from giving due O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Majeſty's ſaid Order, that upon application made to him by our Agent in that City, with all the reſpect due to his Character he declared, that as yet he had got no ſuch Order on our behalf; which by a further Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs we are now to lay before his Majeſty.</p>
                              <p>But whereas we humbly conceive your Lord ſhips to be more immediatly, under his Majeſty the Guardians of the Laws and Liberties of this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45975:75"/>Kingdom, We think it our duty to repreſent to your Lordſhips the Conſequences of the ſaid Memorial, both with relation to our Company in particular, and the Privileges, Intereſt, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Dignity, and Reputation of the Nation in general.</p>
                              <p>Your Lordſhips very well know of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Succeſs of this Company is to the whole Kingdom, and that ſcarce any particular So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or Corporation within the ſame can juſtly boaſt of ſo ſolemn and unanimous a Suffrage or Sanction, as the Acts of Parliament by which this Company is eſtabliſhed. So that if effectual meaſures be not taken for putting an early ſtop to ſuch an open and violent Infringement of, and Incroachment upon the Privileges of ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn a Conſtitution, 'tis hard to gueſs how far it may in after Ages be made uſe of as a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for invading and overturning even the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fundamental Rights, natural Liberties, and indiſputable Independency of this Kingdom, which by the now open and frequent Practices of our unkind Neighbours, ſeem to be too ſhrewdly pointed at. And ſhould this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (wherein the moſt conſiderable of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Gentry, Merchants, and whole Body of the Royal Burroughs are concerned) be ſo unhappy (which God forbid) as to have its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns rendered unſucceſsful through the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable evil Treatments of our ſaid Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; moſt certain it is that no conſideration whatever can hereafter induce this Nation to join in any ſuch other publick Stock, tho never ſo advantageous an undertaking, as not doubting but to meet with the like or greater Diſcouragements from thoſe who give ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and manifeſt Indications of their Deſigns to

                  <p>Notwithſtanding all this humble Application, there was no ſtop put to that Oppoſition: So that the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> dar'd not venture to ſubſcribe; and the Company, after great loſs of time, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and leaving two Ships unfiniſh'd, to the great Diſhonour, as well as Diſadvantage of the Nation, were oblig'd to recal their Agents, after having ſpent 30000 <hi>l</hi> and not receiv'd one Farthing there, tho the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> were ſo willing to join, that they were ſorry there was not room left for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing more than 200000 <hi>l</hi>

                  <p>By all this it is evideht, that the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland</hi> was unanimous in this matter and proceeded deliberately in it, as that which highly concern'd their Intereſt: yet we ſee that all their Endeavours were to no purpoſe; for our Enemies were ſo reſolute in oppoſing our Trade, that rather than it ſhould ſucceed they will not only trample under foot the Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the Laws of Nations, and exactly follow the Pattern ſet them by the <hi>French,</hi> in huffing and tyrannizing over their Neighbours, when at the ſame time they pretend to make War upon <hi>Lewis</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:45975:78"/>XIV. for practices of the ſame nature; and whilſt they cry out upon the Deciſions of the Chambers of <hi>Briſac</hi> and <hi>Mets,</hi> and of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris</hi> as tyrannical and unjuſt for invading the Rights of Neighbouring Princes and Nations, they ſet up a Cabal at <hi>Whitehall</hi> to do the like by <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh.</hi> Then let the World judg, whether the King of <hi>England</hi> had not leſs reaſon to ſay that he was ill ſerv'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> than the King of <hi>Scots</hi> had to ſay that he was ill ſerv'd in <hi>England,</hi> ſince one ſingle Addreſs from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> prevail'd with their King to forbid all his Subjects to join with the <hi>Scots;</hi> whereas the repeated Supplications of the Company of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Addreſs of their Parliament, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Law, and his own Letters Patent could not prevail with the King of <hi>Scots</hi> to do Juſtice to his own Subjects. We wiſh theſe Gentlemen would conſider this, who were ſo very angry at the Author of the Defence of the <hi>Scots</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for ſaying that the King of <hi>Scots</hi> was detain'd priſoner in <hi>England.</hi> It is very certain, that never any King of <hi>Scotland</hi> before the Union of the Crowns, dar'd thus to trample upon their Laws, or to oppoſe the General Intereſt of the Nation; or if they attempted to do it, they were quickly made ſenſible of their being inferior to the Law, and the States of the Nation aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who till the Acceſſion of our Princes to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne, remain'd in an undiſputed poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of calling their Kings to an account for Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adminiſtration, and of diſpoſing of thei Lives and Liberties as they ſaw cauſe. We need not go ſo far back for Evidence to prove this, as <hi>Eugenius</hi> the 7th, who was brought to his Tryal on ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of having murder'd his own Wife, and acquitted upon diſcovery of the real Murderers; or of <hi>James</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:45975:78"/>III. whoſe Minions, by whoſe Council he govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were taken out of his own Bed-Chamber by the Nobles, and hanged over <hi>Lauder-bridg;</hi> and he himſelf perſiſting in thoſe Courſes, was killed in flight, after being defeated in Battle by the States, and in the next Parliament was voted to be lawfully ſlain.</p>
                  <p>We have a later Inſtance, and the Power of our Nation on that Head was largely aſſerted and accounted for by the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> then Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in that noble Memorial he delivered in to Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Council in defence of our proceedings againſt Q. <hi>Mary</hi> whom we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd, and in her ſtead ſet up her Son: ſo that it is not the principle or practice of any one Party of our Nation (tho it has been of late fix'd upon the Presbyterians as peculiar to them) but was an Hereditary Right conveyed to us all by our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, practiſed by Papiſts before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and juſtiſied by thoſe of the Epiſcopal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion ſince, particularly by the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> beforemention'd, who was the firſt that introduc'd Biſhops into our Church after the Reformation.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe things are not inſiſted upon with any Deſign of applying them to his preſent Majeſty, or of incenſing the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> to do ſo, but only to inform thoſe that put his Majeſty upon ſuch Courſes, that they are his greateſt Enemies, and do what in them lies to deſtroy him. It is the common Right of Mankind to be protected by thoſe they ſet over them, and to complain of Governors when they find themſelves aggriev'd, and their Privileges torn from them by Violence. This Generation has prov'd it beyond poſſibility of Reply, that the greateſt Pretenders to ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Princes, and the moſt zealous Patrons of Paſſive Obedience, will reſiſt and dethrone their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45975:79"/>Kings too, when they find themſelves oppreſſed by them. They that maintain the contrary, are nothing but mean-ſpirited Flatterers, or ſuch as temporize with Courts, becauſe of their own private Advantage; and be their Quality what it will, are far from being ſo noble and brave as that poor Woman who told <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> that he ceas'd to be King when he refus'd to hear her Petition. Upon the whole it will appear, that he Author of the Defence of the <hi>Scots</hi> Settlement, made the beſt Apology for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty that could be made, when he ſaid that he was a Priſoner in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore forc'd to act thus againſt the Intereſt and Dignity of his Crown as King of <hi>Scots.</hi> It is demonſtrated thus: If his Majeſty were in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon the Throne of <hi>England,</hi> it is certain his Majeſty would have encouraged the Trade of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and reſented ſuch practices in the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as contrary to the Laws of Nations, and the Soveraignty of his Crown: If he did not, he would be look'd upon to be mean-ſpirited, and not fit to wear it; and if he took part with the King of <hi>England</hi> againſt the Dignity of his Crown, and the Intereſt of his Kingdom, he would not only be looked upon as an Enemy to his Country, but as <hi>felo de ſe.</hi> From all which it is plain, that as it is the beſt Apology that can be made for the King of <hi>Scots</hi> when he acts thus, contrary to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Intereſt of himſelf and his Country, to ſay, he is a Priſoner in <hi>England;</hi> ſo it is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Juſtification of the People of <hi>Scotland</hi> to refuſe Obedience to what he commands by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or other Councils, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Intereſt, becauſe they are the Commands of a Captive, and not of the King of <hi>Scots.</hi> If our Enemies ſay he is no Captive, but at Liberty
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45975:79"/>to go to <hi>Scotland</hi> if he pleaſes, it is ſo far from making his Caſe better, that it makes it ten times worſe; for if his Affections be captivated, we are without remedy, except we either ſue for a Divorce, as in caſe of wilful Deſertion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying conjugal Duty, or withdraw from under his roof, and remove to another Family, as God and Man will allow one Siſter to do that is oppreſſed, and denied the Privileges of paternal Love and Protection, whilſt another is careſſed and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, and has her Fortune raiſed by diminiſhing that of the neglected Siſter.</p>

                  <p>It contains a heavy Charge againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> Company as having ſettled in <hi>Darien</hi> without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his Majeſty, and having thereby broke the Peace betwixt his Majeſty and his Allies. As to their not intorming his Majeſty with their Deſign, there was neither any need of it, nor had they reaſon to do it: that there was no need of it, is plain enough from the Act of Parliament impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to ſettle any where in <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> upon places not inhabited, or any other place, with conſent of the Natives, and not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd by any <hi>European</hi> Potentate, Prince or State: So that they were under no Obligation to acquaint him where they deſign'd to ſettle, provided they kept to the Terms of the Act. And that they had no cauſe ſo to do, is evident from that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable oppoſition that a Faction of Court had prevailed with him to make to them all along, which gave them juſt cauſe to expect the like treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in time to come.</p>
                  <p>Then as to the Breach of the Peace betwixt his Majeſty and his Allies by the Settlement, they had no reaſon to think themſelves guilty of any ſuch thing, and ſo much the leſs, that <hi>Dampier, Wafer,</hi> and all others that wrote of the Country gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45975:80"/>of the Natives being in poſſeſſion of their Liberty, and almoſt in continual Wars with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Beſides, it was a rul'd Caſe in <hi>England,</hi> ſince Capt. <hi>Sharp</hi> was by Law acquitted in King <hi>Charles</hi> Il's time, not only for having marched through <hi>Darien</hi> in a Hoſtile manner, but for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacquing Places that were really in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as St. <hi>Maria</hi> and <hi>Panama,</hi> becauſe he acted by virtue of a Commiſſion from thoſe <hi>Darien</hi> Princes. This, together with their not finding a <hi>Spaniard</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gariſon on all that part of the Iſthmus, was enough to juſtify the fairneſs of the <hi>Scots</hi> Settlement there, and to have put a ſtop to this haſty Sentence till both ſides had been heard.</p>
                  <p>But inſtead of that, the Adviſers to this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation take upon them, in a very Magiſterial manner, to declare the <hi>Scots</hi> guilty of a Breach of the Peace betwixt his Majeſty and his Allies: which is ſo much the more remarkable, that this Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is publiſh'd in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> before ever it was known what the <hi>Scots</hi> could ſay in their own defence; and ſent away before the preſenting of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Memorial, which was on the third of <hi>May</hi> 1699. and the Proclamation bears date <hi>April 9th</hi> 1699.</p>
                  <p>The unfairneſs of this Proclamation is evident from this, that at the very ſame time it is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the Lord Preſident of the Seſſions, and his Majeſty's Advocate for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were ſent for from hence to ſee what they could ſay to juſtify their Pretenſions to <hi>Darien;</hi> which they did by ſuch Arguments as have not yet been anſwer'd.</p>
                  <p>We leave it then to the impartial Thoughts of the good People of <hi>England,</hi> whether we have not occaſion to ſay that our King is in the Hand of our Enemies, ſince we are thus condemn'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45975:81"/>a hearing, and our Nation put tothe trouble and expence to ſend Lawyers out of the Kingdom to defend themſelves before thoſe that had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready condemned them. And ſince this is a viſible effect of the Union of the Crowns, by which we are every day more and more oppreſſed; let them ſpeak their Conſciences, if we have not all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World to diſſolve that Union, except the Nations be more cloſely united, and upon a better footing.</p>
                  <p>That we were ſo treated in former Reigns, we had no great cauſe to wonder, when the Court was engaged in a Conſpiracy againſt our Religion and Liberties. And our Nation being inferior to none in their Zeal for both, it was but natural to think that we ſhould be the firſt Sacrifice: But to be treated thus by a Prince who hath ventur'd his Life to ſave us from Popery and Slavery; a Prince who for Courage in War, and Conduct in Peace, is not to be match'd in Story; a Prince who is under God the Great Champion of our Religion, and the bold Aſſerter of <hi>Europe</hi>'s Liberty; a Prince whoſe Family we revere, and whoſe Perſon we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore; a Prince for whom we have ſo chearfully ventur'd our Lives, and loſt ſo much of the beſt Blood in our Veins; to be ſo treated by ſuch a Prince hath ſome thing cutting beyond expreſſion, and proves that our Diſaſters are no way to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, but either by a total Separation, or a cloſer Union of the two Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>We cannot be ſo unjuſt to his Majeſty's Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as to think a Prince of his Magnanimity could be guilty of ſo mean a thing as willingly to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Crown of his Antient Kingdom which he received free, to that of another. We cannot once ſuffer it to enter into our thoughts, that he who dares to out-brave Death in the Field a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45975:81"/>times a day, ſhould act ſo unworthy a part as firſt to condemn, and then to try us. Theſe and all other things of that ſort we muſt needs charge to the account of our Enemies about him, who miſrepreſent us, and therefore ſurpriſe his Majeſty into any thing he does againſt us.</p>
                  <p>As to that poſitive Sentence of our having acted contrary to the Peace betwixt his Majeſty and his Allies, we have all the Reaſon in the World to complain of it. Is our Kingdom then become ſo mean and contemptible, that what is tranſacted according to the Acts of our Parliaments, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of our Kings, is liable to be annull'd, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared illegal, by any Perſon that has the hap to be made an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Secretary of State, Governor of one of their <hi>American</hi> Plantations, or a Member of their Council of Trade? If it be ſo, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Dignity, as King of <hi>Scots,</hi> is well defended in the mean time, when it is liable thus to be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon by his own Servants as King of <hi>England.</hi> This does indeed veriſy what has been ſaid, that our Kings ſince the Union leave their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Kingdom to the diſpoſal of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: but whether this be agreeable to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation Oaths of our Kings, let them determine that are concern'd to enquire; and perhaps it may be worth the conſideration of our Neighbours, whether ſince we have been govern'd by Servants, they have not for the moſt part been ſubject to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that the one does naturally pave the way for the other. So that they are no great gainers by the Bargain.</p>
                  <p>If it be anſwer'd, that the Proclamations are iſſued by his Majeſty's Authority, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sentence proceeds from his Bar.</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, 1. That there are ſhrewd Suſpitions that a certain Gentleman or two who have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45975:82"/>all along to ſhew their Zeal againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> in this Affair, have puſh'd this matter beyond their Inſtructions; for there's no man that knows his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Juſtice and Wiſdom, can admit a thought that he would condemn us before we were heard.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We don't at all queſtion his Majeſty's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as King of <hi>England,</hi> to forbid his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects to give any manner of Aſſiſtance to the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Darien</hi> (tho we might ſay it was unkind) but we abſolutely deny that he has any Authority as King of <hi>England</hi> to condemn the Proceedings of the Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> for any thing they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act without the Dominions of <hi>England.</hi> If it be otherwiſe, his Majeſty, as King of <hi>Scots,</hi> is bound to appear at the <hi>King's-Bench-bar</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> for what he hath done as King of <hi>Scots,</hi> upon the Lord Chief Juſtices Summons; and of what Conſequence this may be to himſelf or his Succeſſors, may be eaſily judg'd. Had <hi>Oliver,</hi> and the other Regicides, bethought themſelves of this, it had been more for the Honour of <hi>England,</hi> and would have taken off a great deal of the odium that is charg'd upon them for cutting off King <hi>Charles,</hi> had they ſearch'd for ſomething Criminal in his Conduct toward the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation as King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and condemned him for that. Tho they did not think upon this, perhaps others may; and then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will be able to juſtify themſelves as not having cut off their own King, but their Enemy the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> as there's no doubt they would have done by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. had he not made his eſcape after the battel of <hi>Worceſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This may perhaps deſerve the thoughts of his preſent Majeſty and others concern'd in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and ſo much the more that the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> upon that of <hi>England</hi> hath been lately aſſerted by ſome <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45975:82"/>Hiſtorians, and indirectly hinted at in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Anſwer to the <hi>Defence of the</hi> Scots <hi>Settlement at</hi> Darien, p. 24.</p>
                  <p>But to ſatisfy that Gentleman and others, who pleaſe themſelves ſo much in vilifying the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, they may turn to the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> I. II. &amp; III. and they will quickly find that Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Wallace,</hi> K. <hi>Robert Bruce, James</hi> Lord <hi>Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Thomas Randolph</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> and others that we could name, did ſo gallantly defend the Soveraignty of <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt thoſe bold Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to a Superiority over us, that their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors have had no great ſtomach to purſue their Claim to it ſince: So that if ever they had any, it is forfeited by Preſcription.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oliver</hi>'s imaginary Conqueſt ſo much inſiſted on by the dull Anſwerer of the <hi>Scots</hi> Defence, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, will be of no uſe to the Faction in this matter, ſince that was no National Quarrel, nor did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pretend to any ſuch thing, as a Conqueſt of us, but immediatly withdrew their Forces upon the Reſtoration. So that <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Conqueſt, as he calls it, was only the Victory of one Party over another in a Civil War, it being well known that he had Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi> as well as <hi>England,</hi> which (if that Wiſe Author will have <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Victories to be Conqueſts) he had conquer<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d too before ever he came near <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We don't inſiſt upon this with any deſign to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the Valour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, which is known all over the World, but to ſtop the mouths of thoſe pitiful Scriblers, and to give a <hi>Caveat</hi> to thoſe Gentlemen about Court, who talk ſo big of conquering <hi>Scotland</hi> upon this preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                  <p>But we wiſh them to conſult beforehand how <hi>England</hi> in general ſtands affected to ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45975:83"/>and how they will juſtify the Lawfulneſs of it, leſt it fare with them as it did with K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. and his Cabal, who not only in Council advis'd, TO REDUCE US TO OUR DUTY BY FORCE RATHER THAN GIVE WAY TO OUR DEMANDS, as may be ſeen in the <hi>Repreſentation of the States of</hi> Scotland in 1640. but rais'd Money, and levied a formidable Army to carry on their Deſign; and yet the Hearts of theſe Bravos fail'd them when they came in view of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who repuls'd them twice with ſhame, the firſt time when they encamp'd their great Army near <hi>Barwick,</hi> and the next when we charg'd them at <hi>Newburn.</hi> And at laſt the beſt of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England</hi> thought fit to put a ſtop to thoſe dangerous Proceedings, and follow'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with a Proteſtation againſt them, as well knowing, that if <hi>Scotland</hi> were once ſubdued, the Liberties of <hi>England</hi> could not be long liv'd.</p>
                  <p>That it is the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> now to prevent the Ruin of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as much as it was then, will appear by the following Arguments.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That the preſent Juncture of Affairs makes it neceſſary for the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> rather to ſtrengthen themſelves by making new Friends than by procuring new Enemies. They are not ignorant that they have a controverted Title to their Crown entail'd upon them, and that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders againſt thoſe in poſſeſſion are in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and under their Protection. Nor can they be ignorant, that to the old National Hatred betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> have added that of the Proteſtant Religion. Of late years they have declared themſelves the moſt implacable Enemies of it; and their King in all his Triumphs has that aſcrib'd to him as his greateſt Exploit, that he hath quelled the Monſter of Hereſy. The caſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45975:83"/>being thus, it muſt needs be againſt the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to ſuffer any froward and headſtrong Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to embroil them with <hi>Scotland,</hi> or to ruin that Kingdom; the Conſequence of which will be the expoſing themſelves as an eaſier Prey to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>French</hi> or any other Enemy.
<p>That the <hi>French</hi> had a hand in fomenting our late Civil Wars, and made uſe of their Firebrands in all Parties, is beyond diſpute; and that it is now more their Intereſt to divide us than ever, is ſo palpable that it cannot be denied. Nothing in human probability could have ſtop'd the impetuous Current of their Arms, but the Interpoſition of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> and therefore it concerns them, both in point of Intereſt and Revenge, to daſh us againſt one another: and if the ill Uſage that we meet with from the Court of <hi>England</hi> ſhould force us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into a <hi>French</hi> or other Alliance, the World cannot blame us; ſince the Laws of Nature and Nations are for us. Put the caſe that a ſmaller num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſtians ſhould be unjuſtly attack'd by a greater, whom nothing will ſatisfy but the utter Ruin of the former: Could any man in conſcience blame the weaker Party to call in the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Jews</hi> and Pagans to preſerve their own Lives? Is it not the ſame caſe with the <hi>Scots?</hi> have they not ever ſince the Union of the Crowns been oppreſſed and tyranniz'd over by a Faction in <hi>England,</hi> who will neither admit of an Union of the Nations, nor leave the <hi>Scots</hi> in poſſeſſion of their own Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, as Men and Chriſtians? Was it not a Party in <hi>England</hi> that impos'd upon us firſt in Matters of Religion? Did we ſend firſt to oblige them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the <hi>Geneva</hi> Diſciplin, as they call it; or was it they that firſt impoſed their Ceremonies and Forms of Prayer upon us? Was it we who firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded them with an Army to ſubvert their Civil and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45975:84"/>Religious Liberties, or did not they firſt invade us? Was it we who firſt made Acts againſt their Trade, or they who made Acts deſtructive of ours? Did we iſſue Proclamations againſt their Colonies, or have they done ſo by ours? In the name of God then let them declare what they would have us to do. They will not unite with us, nor ſuffer us to live by our ſelves: Nor muſt we have any ſhare of their Trade, or carry on a Trade by our ſelves. Is it not plain then that the Faction oppreſs us? and yet we muſt not complain of this ſort of Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. If the State of Affairs in <hi>Ireland</hi> be conſider'd, it will appear to be ſuch, as may make it dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſuffer the <hi>Scots</hi> to be oppreſſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd in this manner It is well enough known that the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> are not very well pleas'd with their Treatment by ſome in <hi>England.</hi> This, together with the great numbers of <hi>Scots</hi> in the North of that Kingdom, who bear a natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to their Country, and would be very uneaſy to ſee its Ruin, may prove of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, in caſe of a Rupture with <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. It will further appear to be the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> not to ſuffer the <hi>Scots</hi> to be ſo much run down, if they conſider the poſture of their own Affairs at home. The Diviſions and Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties betwixt the ſeveral Parties in <hi>England</hi> are well enough known: So that beſides the Sport it would afford to the common Enemy of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Country, to ſee thoſe two Nations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in War, the Enemies of the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would be ſure to improve it, and watch for an opportunity to avenge themſelves for what has been done againſt the late K. <hi>James,</hi> and his Friends. It is well enough known what hopes they and ſome People beyond Sea conceive from the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45975:84"/>Differences that this Treatment of the <hi>Scots</hi> may probably occaſion; and as they have an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable Hatred againſt our Nation, becauſe we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd ſo generally againſt the late King, and are ſo zealous for his preſent Majeſty, there's no doubt but they will foment our Diviſions as much as they can, and inſinuate themſelves with both Parties, in order to ſet them together by the Ears. They know that ſo many as fall in <hi>England</hi> of thoſe who adhere to the preſent Conſtitution, and ſo many as fall in <hi>Scotland</hi> for ſupporting the Trade and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their Country, ſo many Enemies they are rid of; therefore there's no queſtion but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelves a plentiful fiſhing in ſuch troubled Waters.
<p>It likewiſe deſerves the conſideration of our Neighbours, that they don't ſtand at preſent in very good terms as to matter of Trade with <hi>France, Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> nor is it well known what the Iſſue of the preſent Controverſy with <hi>Spain</hi> about regulating their Succeſſion may be. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending differences betwixt the Northern Crowns may perhaps in a little time imbroil them with one or other of them, and affect their Trade alſo on that ſide. All which being conſider'd, it would ſeem to be the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Friendſhip of the <hi>Scots,</hi> by treating them in a kind and neighbourly manner.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. It will appear in particular not to be the Intereſt of the Diſſenters and ſober Churchmen, that the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould be thus run down, becauſe their own Ruin will be the unavoidable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it. This they may ſoon be convinc'd of if they will give themſelves leave to conſider how they were treated in K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's time, when the Court did ſwell with ſo much Rage againſt the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> for aſſerting their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45975:85"/>then, as they do now. All thoſe Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>-men that could not conform to the Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons brought into the Church by <hi>Laud</hi> and his Party, were treated as Puritans and Schiſmaticks; and thoſe that appear'd for the Liberties of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Ship-money and other Arbitrary Impoſitions of the Court, were treated as Rebels and Traitors. If they look into the two laſt Reigns, it will appear as plain as the Sun, that when <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tand</hi> was oppreſs'd, and their Liberties wreſted from them, the Diſſenters and moderate Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>England</hi> were brought under the laſh: the former were depriv'd of their Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the latter expos'd to deſtruction by Sham-plots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe of their appearing for the Laws of their Country. We need mention no more Inſtances to put this out of Controverſy, than thoſe deplorable ones of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and Lord <hi>Ruſſel;</hi> to which we may add the ſhameful and barbarous Treatment of the worthy Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> Chaplain to the latter, becauſe he ſo excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended with his Pen the Birth-right and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of all true Engliſhmen.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>From all this it will appear that <hi>England</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral muſt ſuffer by the Ruin of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that thoſe who have all along ſtood up for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, muſt lay their Account to come under the laſh, if once our Necks come under the Yoke: therefore we dare appeal to the ſober Men of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Whether it be their Intereſt that a Nation which agrees with them in all the Articles of their Church, thoſe about Diſcipline excepted, ſhould be deſtin'd to ruin, becauſe we believe with moſt of the Reformed Churches, that there is no Office ſuperiour to that of a Presbyter of divine Inſtitution. Muſt we be denied the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of Men and Chriſtians, becauſe we think
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45975:85"/>that the Diſcipline of the Church may be more ſafely intruſted, and more faithfully adminiſtred by the joint Indeavors of the Miniſter and the Heads of his Congregation, by an Aſſociation of neighbouring Miniſters, and the Heads of their Pariſhes, and by Delegates both of the Clergy and Laity of thoſe Aſſociations in a general Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than by another Model? But enough of this Subject. Let any Man peruſe the learned Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s Treatiſe of <hi>Presbytery and Epiſcopacy reconcil'd,</hi> and there they will find that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is not ſo great as ſome People have made it their buſineſs to make the World believe. But if nothing leſs than our deſtruction will ſerve thoſe Gentlemen, becauſe our Church is of a different Conſtitution from that of <hi>England,</hi> and that our political Principles and original Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are diametrically oppoſite to arbitrary Power, let the Diſſenters of <hi>England,</hi> and all thoſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that concurr'd in the late Revolution, look to it. When their Neighbour's Houſe is on ſire it's time for them to prepare their Bucket's. If this Digreſſion be thought impertinent, <hi>H—s</hi> and the Anſwerer of the <hi>Scots</hi> Defence muſt bear the blame of it. They would inſinuate to the World that the Affair of our Trade and Colony is a Presbyterian Project, on purpoſe to render it odious and ſuſpected to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> therefore it was neceſſary to obviate that falſe and malicious Suggeſtion, and to acquaint our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that the Company make no difference as to the matter of Perſwaſion: and let it be put to the Teſt when they pleaſe, it will be found that thoſe of the Epiſcopal Opinion are as zealous for the thriving of our Trade, and the Honour of our Nation (both of which are concern'd in this Affair) as any of the other.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:45975:86"/>
                  <p>To wind up this matter, if any Party in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> entertain ſuſpicions of us, the better way to prevent us is to treat us kindly, and enter into an Union with us on ſuch Terms as his Majeſty and the Parliament of both Kingdoms ſhall agree, and ſo as the Civil and Religious Liberties of both People may be preſerved. That will be caſier and ſafer than to relie on the Hopes of an uncertain Conqueſt; or if they don't think fit to do ſo, it's but reaſonable they ſhould leave us in the undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd poſſeſſion of our own Liberties: But if they will do neither, let them no more accuſe thoſe that complain of this Treatment as Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, but ſeriouſly examine whether they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves mayn't with more Juſtice be accounted Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors.</p>

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:45975:87"/>which only diſcover his own Temper, but do that honeſt Man no hurt. As to his charging us with <hi>ſquandring away</hi> 50000 l. <hi>on 6 Hulks at</hi> Amſterdam <hi>and</hi> Hamburgh, <hi>purely to make a noiſe of our Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> &amp;c. we would deſire him and his Suborners to reconcile it with what they ſay from <hi>p.</hi> 14, to 20. where they own themſelves that the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Hamburgers</hi> were both mightily pleas'd with the Deſign, <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>That the</hi> Dutch <hi>were tickled with the Conceit that they ſhould be Sharers in the</hi> Scots <hi>Trade;</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 16. they ſay, <hi>That that which gave the dead ſtroke to the</hi> Scots <hi>Deſign, was the</hi> Eaſt <hi>and</hi> Weſt-India <hi>Companies running open mouth'd to the Lords of</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, <hi>ſhewing what was hatching by the</hi> Scots <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners in their City to ruine the Trade of the Vnit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Provinces.</hi> P. 17. they tell us. <hi>That the</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers <hi>thought it the more their Intereſt to embrace the Project, the more that the</hi> Dutch <hi>oppos'd it:</hi> P. 18. <hi>That our Affair was generally favour'd by the Burgers of</hi> Hamburg; and <hi>p.</hi> 21. <hi>That the Government of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>ſent the Senate of</hi> Hamburg <hi>a Caution by Sir</hi> Paul Ricaut <hi>to take care how they ſuffer'd their Burghers to embark with us.</hi> So that here we condemn them from their own mouths: It being plain from thoſe Conceſſions, that we did not idly ſquander away our Money at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> but that both thoſe trading Cities approv'd our Deſign, and would have engag'd in it, had not the Court of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> oppos'd it; and therefore what loſs of Mony we ſuſtain'd in thoſe places, muſt be charg'd to their Account; ſo that <hi>H—s</hi> hath verified the Proverb, That Liars have need of good Memories.</p>
                  <p>This is not the only Inſtance wherein thoſe of <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborners have giv'n them the ſlip; for in the <hi>4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                     </hi> page of the Dedication, they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45975:88"/>upbraid the Company with their blind Project, at which the trading part of the World ſtand amaz'd; yet <hi>p.</hi> 17. they tell us that the Project was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable both on the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Hamburghers</hi> ſide; and the Reaſons they give are theſe, <hi>That the River on which that City ſtands is navigable for</hi> 200 <hi>Miles up into</hi> Germany <hi>for flat-bottom'd Veſſels of</hi> 70 <hi>or</hi> 80 <hi>Tuns,</hi> which gives them an opportunity of ſerving all the North Parts of the Empire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All that they can ſay to ſalve this Contradiction is, <hi>That the</hi> Hamburghers <hi>knew nothing of</hi> Darien, <hi>but builded altogether on Ships laden with</hi> India <hi>Goods;</hi> but that's a notorious Falſhood, for the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> were actually told that our Deſign was on the Iſthmus of <hi>America,</hi> and therefore could not be diſappointed in their Expectations of an <hi>East-India</hi> Trade if they had a mind to have follow'd it, ſince they could not be ignorant that they had thereby an opportunity of ſhortning the Voyage from <hi>Darien</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> But at the ſame time it is much to be queſtion'd whether the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> were ſo intent upon an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, as <hi>H—s</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, ſince it muſt viſibly prejudice their own Manufacture of Linen.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall conclude this of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> with one Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> that he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 14. That one of the Reaſons why the <hi>Dutch</hi> were ſo much taken with our <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Trade, was our Exemption from Duties for 21 years; which ſerves only to diſcover his own Folly and Malice, ſince every Body muſt neceſſarily know, that exemption from Duties was only in the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Ports; ſo that if they were exported from thence into any other Country, they muſt pay the ſame Duties in thoſe Countries, as if they had been directly imported from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Inconſiſtency of <hi>H—s</hi> and his Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45975:88"/>is further demonſtrated, <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>byſuppoſing our buying a couple of ſecond-hand Ships in the</hi> Thames, <hi>and diſpatching them to</hi> India <hi>with a ſutable Cargo.</hi> As to the buying of ſecond-hand Ships, the Company made that Experiment, but found themſelves loſevs by it, and that it coſt them more to fit up a ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand Veſſel for their purpoſe, than it would have done to have bought a new one. But with what Front can they upbraid us with not buying of Ships in the <hi>Thames</hi> for carrying on an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, when they own, <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>that the Houſe of Commons baulk'd us of our Subſcriptions, and repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Subjects of</hi> England <hi>for their foolery?</hi> How is it poſſible then that they would have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd our buying Ships in the <hi>Thames</hi> for carrying on an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade?</p>
                  <p>We have another proof of his Ingenuity and Truth in that ſame Page, where he tells us, that if <hi>our blind Project (meaning that of</hi> Darien) <hi>ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry by our own ill Management, it is not fair we ſhould ſnarl at our Neighbours, who have no other Hand in our Misfortune, than that they would not be acceſſary to any Act which the World might judg Felonious, and wherein they could not join without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging themſelves in an unreaſonable War, and in the end to aſſiſt us with Weapons to break our won Heads.</hi> We wiſh his Maſters much joy of their Advocat and Evidence, for we believe they could not have found ſuch another if they had ſearched through all the Iſland: He juſt now own'd that our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours oppoſed our Subſcriptions at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, before they knew any thing of what he calls <hi>our blind Project,</hi> and made us ſquander away 50000 <hi>l</hi> to little purpoſe, whioh certainly muſt be a <hi>misfortune,</hi> and that wherein our Neighbours had no ſmall hand, tho the World could not judg our taking Subſcriptions in that Honourable
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45975:89"/>manner to be any way Felonious. We have more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſufficently proved it elſewhere, that they have had a hand in our Misfortune by down-right oppoſition, and unaccountable Proclamations for which they had no Authority; we hope that this will be allow'd to be ſomething more than refuſing to be acceſſary to an Act that neither he nor his Suborners will ever be able to prove Felonious, and which we have already told him, the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have in a parallel, nay much worſe caſe, judg'd to be honeſt and righteous.</p>
                  <p>So that all this Author hath got by his charging us maliciouſly with Felony, is to prove himſelf a wilful Felon, for he tells us at the end of his Book of a long diſpute betwixt himſelf and Sir <hi>J. Stewart</hi> his Majeſty's Advocat for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Title of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to <hi>Darien;</hi> and if we may believe <hi>H—s,</hi> he baffled the Advocat, and prov'd the Right of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> which proves himſelf to have engaged in a Deſign that he thought Felonious, for we do not find, by his own Relation, that he left the place from remorſe of Conſcience, but only on the Account of a <hi>Malladie Imaginaire,</hi> and want of Proviſions; ſo that we thank him for telling the World, from his own Mouth, that his Evidence againſt us is that of a Felon.</p>
                  <p>As to their engaging themſelves in an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable War, and aſſiſting us with Weapons to break their own Heads; we did not deſire they ſhould engage in a War for us, but think it very unreaſonable the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court ſhould have engaged ſo far as they have done againſt us: It had been ſufficient for them to have denied us their Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without having condemn'd us as guilty of breach of Alliance, which, as all the other parts of the oppoſition made to us, we are ſatisfied is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45975:89"/>not the Act of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and therefore can create no miſunderſtanding betwixt them and us, but perhaps may prove a Weapon in time to break the Heads of <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborners.</p>
                  <p>In the 5th Page, that his Book may be all of a piece, he advances a forg'd Obligation upon us, from the Union of the Crowns, which is, that we are thereby <hi>deliver'd from the daily Feuds and bloody little Wars that rag'd amongſt us for</hi> 1900 <hi>years, which unnatural Maſſacnes our native Princes were unable to ſuppreſs,</hi> &amp;c. This is down-right falſhood in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact; for thoſe Feuds, as he calls them, ceas'd in the <hi>Lowlands</hi> long before the Union, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſtill in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> which we can ſcarocly think is unknown to our Author who was born ſo near that Country as <hi>Dumbarton.</hi> The <hi>Macdonalds</hi> have been ſeveral times in Arms againſt the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi> ſince the Reſtoration, and there's a Fend now depending between the <hi>Frazers</hi> and the <hi>Murrays,</hi> or rather the Family of <hi>Athol.</hi> Non did we ever hear of any thing that look'd ſo like an unnatural Maſſacre in <hi>Scotland</hi> as that committed ſince tho Revolution upon the Inhabitants of <hi>Glenco,</hi> which had it not been for the Union of the Crowns, would not have been ſuffer'd to go unpuniſhed. But admitting it to be true, that the Union had deliver'd us from thoſe little Feuds, we are no gainers by the Bargain, ſince it hath occaſion'd greater; pavticularly that unnatural Feud which rag'd ſo long betwixt the Epiſcopal Party and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, and had its riſe altogether from the Union of the Crowns; the very proſpect of which, was the ſole cauſe why the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> (when Regent) ſet up the firſt Proteſtant Biſhops in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Into what Couvulſions that Impoſition threw the Nation is well enough known; and how beſides the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45975:90"/>bringing down K <hi>Charles</hi> I. with 30000 Men againſt our Kingdom, and contributing to engage the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a Civil War, it occaſioned King <hi>Charles</hi> II. to plunder the Weſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> firſt by Sir <hi>James Turner,</hi> which gave riſe to the Inſurrection at <hi>Pentland;</hi> and twice afterwards by the <hi>Highland</hi> Hoſt, which occaſion'd that of <hi>Bothwel-Bridg:</hi> And afterwards the Oppreſſion run ſo high, that it forc'd ſome of the Presbyterians into unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Actions, which gave occaſion to oppreſs the whole Party; ſo that it was made puniſhable by Death for any of their Miniſters to preach, or for the People to hear them. From this indeed, we were totally delivered by the Revolution, tho our freedom in that reſpect was partly begun by the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Declaration. But our Enemies, unwilling that our Nation ſhould be long at eaſe, have found other Methods to ſet our Court againſt us: And becauſe they know that his preſent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty has too great a Soul to perſecute any man on the account of Conſcience; our Enemies have chang'd their Battery, and inſtead of pointing their Cannon at our Religion, they level them againſt our Civil Liberties. The Powder they prime their Artillery with, is, That <hi>we are Enemies to Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi> But becauſe this would not go down with the good People of <hi>England,</hi> who are ſtrenuous Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Liberty and Property, they muſt gild it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the ſpecious Pretence, that we have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to undermine their Trade, and have unjuſtly invaded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions. This is the Deſign of <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborners; and therefore they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſo much on our Clandeſtine Declarations, as they call them, that we publiſh'd in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, on purpoſe to drain them of their People; but unhappily overthrow what they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance at the ſame time, when they tell us, That
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45975:90"/>
                     <hi>the</hi> Jamaica <hi>Sloops were Witneſſes that we had neither Proviſions, nor Money for the ſuſtenance of our own People,</hi> pag. 148. And therefore it cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſuppos'd that we had any ſuch deſign as he malicioufly charges us with, to draw over the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, ſince we had not wherewith to ſupport our own; but more of this anon. Our Author learn'd the Maxim of <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niare audacter &amp; aliquid barebit,</hi> when he was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt: And if he and his Suborners can be any way inſtrumental to ſet the Nations together by the Ears by this Method; or if that fail, if they can but raiſe Animoſitys between them, they know it will be a good pretence for ſome people to put his Majeſty upon preſſing for a Standing Army, and perhaps for having it enlarg'd, it being neceſſary, ſay they, to overaw the <hi>Scors,</hi> but in reality to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect ſuch evil Counſellors from being brought to Juſtice, that have advis'd to ſuch Meaſures as viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tend to the diſadvantage of both Nations.</p>
                  <p>It may perhaps be worth the Enquiry of our Neighbours whether this be not the real meaning of this intolerable Oppreſſion exercis'd upon our Nation as to their Trade both at home and abroad, <hi>viz.</hi> that knowing our <hi>prafervidum. Ingenium,</hi> as they are pleas'd to call it, to be impatient under Tyranny, the Faction think thereby to provoke us to a reſentment that may give occaſion for raiſing an Army againſt us; which if it have the good hap to ſubdue us, or force us to digeſt our Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlon without any more to do, ſhall be made uſe of afterwards to chaſtiſe themſelves, and bring them to better Manners, then to limit their Monarchs in their Grants, and leave them no other Troops but their Gariſons and Guards. It was the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valton of the Earl of <hi>Shaſtsbury,</hi> whom his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will own to have been a great Stateſman, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45975:91"/>
                     <hi>Scotland</hi> is a Door to let in Good or Evil upon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which is verified in the latter at leaſt by the whole Courſe of our Hiſtory ſince the Union: for when K. <hi>James</hi> I. ſucceeded in trampling upon us, he quickly began to huff his Parliaments in <hi>England;</hi> and notwithſtanding all the Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Church and State, would needs have a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Match for his Son, tho he ſhould ſacrifice the Great Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> his own Daughter the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and her Children, together with the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>Germany,</hi> to make way for it. When <hi>Charles</hi> I. obtain'd footing for his. Impoſitions on the Church and State of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it's well enough known what Methods he took with <hi>England,</hi> and how he ſacrific'd the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>France,</hi> whilſt he eagerly purſued an Arbitrary Sway at home. When <hi>Charles</hi> II. got his Prerogative exalted, and an Army at his Call allow'd him in <hi>Scotland,</hi> i'ts too late to be forgotten how he trod under foot the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> ſeiz'd the Charters of their Cities, cut off whom he would by Sham-Plots, and pav'd the way for Popery and Arbitrary Power. When K. <hi>James</hi> II. did by his abſolute Power and unaccountable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority caſs and annul all the Laws eſtabliſhing the Reformation in <hi>Sootland;</hi> it was not long e're he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the Laws, impriſon'd the Biſhops, and fill'd with Papiſts his Council, Army, and Univerſities in <hi>England.</hi> From all which it is evident that our Neighbours have reaſon to look to themſelves when we are oppreſs'd; for in all probability their Acts of Parliament will not be long regarded, when ours are annull'd and made void by the Intrigues of the Courtiers, and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Proclamations. The very Advocats of Tyranny make uſe of this as their <hi>Herculean</hi> Argument, That the People hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once reſign'd their Privileges to the Crown,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45975:91"/>have no more right to demand them; which tho we will not allow to be any ways concluding, yet we may very well make uſe of it <hi>ad hominem,</hi> that <hi>a pari ratione,</hi> when once a Prince has touch'd with his Scepter a Law for the benefit of his Subjects, it is not in his power to revoke or counteract it; or if he do, by the ſame Power that he abſolves himſelf from his Obligation to protect and defend his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he abſolves them from all obligation to pay him any Revenue or Allegiance. This is the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of all <hi>Scots</hi>-men; and if our Neighbours in <hi>England</hi> have a mind to ſit ſtill, and fee us bereft of it, all the benefit they can expect from it, is to have the Privilege of being devour'd laſt.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of his Banter upon his native Country ſerves only to leſſen his own credit, and to make even thoſe that ſet him at work, curſe him in thought, not only as a Monſter in nature, but as diſhoneſt to them, by depriving them thus of the benefit of his Evidence, for which they have paid him ſo well; ſince no body in the world can think a man will have any regard to Truth, that in ſuch an impudent manner breaks thro all the Ties of Nature; and as a juſt Judgment for ſo enormous a Crime, is ſo far depriv'd of his reaſoning Faculty, that he is not ſenſible of his cutting his own Throat, by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting himſelf almoſt in every Paragraph. He up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids us in one Page with not having dar'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the Plains, and that thoſe gallant Men our Anceſtors durſt not aſſemble for Worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Union, except in a Houſe whoſe Wall was twelve or 14 foot thick, or to whiſper their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Carrols thro the Cliffs of the Mountains: In the next Page he tells us he has no Inclination to offer any thing in oppoſition to the Gallantry of our Anceſtors; and in ſome Pages following he imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently ridicules the Valour of our Country in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45975:92"/>Story of <hi>Baliol,</hi> which he perverts in ſuch a manner, as no man but himſelf is capable of.</p>
                  <p>We don't think it worth while to anſwer him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Folly, but ſhall once for all let him know, that the moſt invective of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, that wrote in the heat of the War, do us more Juſtice than this unnatural Renegado. There's no Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> where we have not given proofs of our Valour, nor is there a Court in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> where <hi>Scots</hi>-men are not valued on that account. <hi>Sam. Daniel,</hi> one of the beſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, owns that never any People of the World did more gallantly defend their Liberties than we did in that very inſtance of <hi>Baliol,</hi> when we were without a Head; and from thence infers, what was it we could not have done, had we been then under the conduct of ſuch a Leader as K. <hi>Robert Bruce. Speed,</hi> one of the graveſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtorians, does generouſly own, that few great Actions have been perform'd in <hi>Europe,</hi> where the <hi>Scots</hi> have not been with the firſt and laſt in the Field.</p>
                  <p>We could eaſily give a proper Reply to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Romance which he brings about <hi>Baliol,</hi> that would tend as much or more to the diſhonour of <hi>Edward</hi> I. II. and III. than any thing that he and his Suborners have ſuggeſted can tend to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Nation; but we forbear it, having no deſign to reflect upon our Neighbours, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the rude Treatment and Provocation that we have had from <hi>H—s,</hi> and others on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. We can, without thinking our ſelves injur'd, own that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are as brave Men as any in the World, and are ſatisfied, that ſuch of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as are Men of Honour and Reading, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us the ſame Character. We perceive it is the deſign of this Libeller and others to repreſent the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation as Enemies to us in this matter, on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45975:92"/>purpoſe to ſet us together by the Ears; but we are ſatisfied of the contrary, as well knowing that not a few of our good Neighbours are much ſurpriz'd and diſpleas'd with our Treatment, and look upon the ſame to be the effect of ſuch Councils as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Intereſt of both Nations.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall conclude this point with one Obſervation more upon <hi>H—s</hi>'s Ignorance and Malice, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that the <hi>Scots</hi> expell'd <hi>Baliol</hi> from the Crown, when ſuch a noble Monument of the truth of it, as the original Letter of the States of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is ſtill to be ſeen in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and exemplify'd by Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Reformation; and ſince it is alſo plain that our Anceſtors choſe <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> King during <hi>Baliol</hi>'s Life-time, and that <hi>Baliol</hi> at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd all his Pretenſions, confeſs'd his Fault in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> to that of <hi>England,</hi> own'd that he was deſervedly thruſt from the Throne for it, congratulated his Kinſman <hi>Robert Bruce</hi>'s Advancement, and that he had reſtor'd the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> to its antient Honour.</p>
                  <p>We take no notice of his profane and atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Banter upon the Religion of our Country, as being ſatisfied that that will do his Cauſe no good amongſt thinking men, tho it may pleaſe thoſe that he is only fit to converſe with. As for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious charge on Presbyterians, that they maintain it as their Principle, <hi>That Dominion is founded on Grace;</hi> it's of a piece with the reſt of his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He and his Suborners will be very hard put to it to quote one of their Authors to prove the Aſſertion, and therefore they may well reject it as a ſlander: but we muſt tell him that if this be the Principle of the Presbyterians, they have not well anſwer'd it by their practice; for whenever they had any ſuch thing as <hi>Dominion</hi> at their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45975:93"/>they ſeldom had the good hap to confer it upon thoſe that had <hi>Grace</hi> enough to anſwer the ends of it. We forbear Inſtances, becauſe it's too well known both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We come next to examine his Charge upon our Colony on purpoſe to render them odious to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and all the World, and ſhall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it <hi>verbatim,</hi> that the reaſon of our Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon it may be the more obvious.

                  <p>
                     <q>If your Colony has left <hi>Darien</hi> for Reaſons not as yet public to the World, 'tis your fault, Right Worſhipful Gentlemen, in undertaking to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a Project you ſo little underſtood, and not of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, whoſe Intereſt it is to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and preſerve their own Colonies, and to keep them from being render'd deſolate by the clandeſtine Artiſices of yours, who induſtriouſly and tacitely ſpread their Declarations over all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Iſlands and Plantations, making uſe of the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi>'s Name, to give more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the thing: And by thoſe indirect <hi>Manifeſtos,</hi> ſuch Profits, or rather Plunders were inſinuated, that if the Government of <hi>England</hi> had not taken early meaſures to prevent the ill Conſequences, it's to be queſtion'd whether the greateſt part of the <hi>Engliſh Weſt Indies</hi> had not e're now quitted their Settlements, and been decoyed into your Colony, under a cover'd Notion, that you had a Patent from the King to pick a quarrel with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and to divide the Spoil of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> amongſt the Servants and Adventurers of the Company.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This indeed is ſomething to the purpoſe, and might deſerve the Suborners Mony, were there no poſſibility of proving it falſe; but we ſhall ſee anon what ground there is for this bold Accuſation, after obſerving.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:45975:93"/>
                  <p>That perhaps ſome Gentlemen at the Weſt end of the Town may find at long-run that their Evidence has blab'd out ſomething more in this Paragraph than it's for their Intereſt the World ſhould know. We will only ask Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> ſome civil Queſtions: What are thoſe Reaſons not as yet publick to the World, for which our Colony left <hi>Darien?</hi> Sir <hi>William Beeſton</hi>'s Letter acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us that it was for want of Proviſions, and for fear of the great Preparations by the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> The Letters we have had ſince from <hi>New-York</hi> ſay, that it was for want of Proviſions, and becauſe they were brought to their wits end, and did not know what to think of their Caſe by reaſon of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proclamations. Then ſince the very firſt of theſe, and much more all of them together, were reaſon ſufficient, and are publick to the World, What other private reaſons can Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> give us for it? We know he boaſts of his Intereſt in thoſe that are concerned in the Secrets of the Weſt End of the Town: Did they tell him then that the Government of <hi>England</hi> took <hi>early Meaſures</hi> to prevent the ill Conſequences of our Colony? If they did ſo, pray what were thoſe Meaſures? Was the ſending of Capt. <hi>Long</hi> thither to debauch our Men, traduce us to the <hi>Indians</hi> as Pirats, and to tell them his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> would not protect us, one of thoſe early Meaſures? Was not their ſolliciting a foreign Miniſter to preſent a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial againſt our Colony as ſoon as ever the News of it arriv'd, another? And was not this the reaſon why they put it upon that Miniſter, and not upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, that the latter had been forbid coming to Court, becauſe his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty would not admit of <hi>Schonenburg</hi> the the <hi>Jew</hi> as Envoy from the <hi>Dutch?</hi> Were not the Enemies of the <hi>Scots</hi> Company ſo zealous in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45975:94"/>that Memorial, that they could not have patience till orders came from <hi>Madrid,</hi> but put the Envoy upon it of themſelves? And when a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy happen'd about receiving it ſigned or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd becauſe of the difference betwixt the two Courts, did not our Enemies agree to it as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, that one of both ſorts ſhould be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Was not this abominable trifling upon a point of Honour, when they were plotting to bereave the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> of their Honour, Men, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Colony all at once? Were not theſe more clandeſtine and indirect Artifices to deſtroy our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, than any he charges upon us to deſtroy the Engliſh Colonies?</p>
                  <p>Having ask'd Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> more Queſtions than he and his Suborners dare poſitively anſwer, we come next to deny his Charge upon our Colony, as being malicious and abſolutely falſe; for which their own Declaration ſhall be our Evidence, and is as follows.</p>

                  <p>We dare refer it to the Scrutiny of the niceſt Obſervers, whether this Declaration infer any ſuch thing as <hi>Plunder,</hi> or a Patent from the King to pick a Quarrel with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to divide the Spoil of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru;</hi> what clandeſtine Artifices are here to be found to drain the Engliſh Plantations, and wherein does it interfere with the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> any more than all free Ports muſt of neceſſity interfere with their Neighbours? We wiſh that our Author would inform us how publick Declarations according to Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be call'd clandeſtine Artiſices, and defy him and his Suborners with all their art to find any thing pretended to in this Declaration, but what the Colony has a right to by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The only thing this malicious Scribler can wreſt to his Purpoſe in the Declaration, is the Colony's publiſhing that all manner of Perſons, of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or People ſoever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be equally free, and alike capable of the ſame Privileges with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the expreſs Words of the Act of Parliament; and therefore ſuppoſing that the ſaid Declaration ſhould have influenc'd ſome People to come over to them from the Engliſh Plantations, the Colony could not be any ways blam'd for it. <hi>Qui utitur jure ſuo nil damni facit,</hi> is a known Maxim in Maw.</p>
                  <p>The Libeller's Malice is not ſatisfied with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon our Colony, but flies on the face of the greateſt part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> as if they had ſo little Honour or Love for their native Country, as to lay their own Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deſolate, and run over to ours. Indeed if moſt of them be ſuch Perſons as himſelf, there might be ſome ground for the Reflection; but till it appears to be ſo, we muſt beg Mr. <hi>H</hi>—<hi>s</hi>'s
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45975:96"/>leave to have a better opinion of them. No Man of ſenſe can believe that thoſe who found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at eaſe in the Engliſh Plantations, would be fond of removing to a new Colony; but if others who are at their freedom had a mind to do ſo, we know of no reaſon they ſhould be hinder'd. The Subjects of <hi>England</hi> are a free People, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to their own Dominions, but have liberty to trade and live elſewhere, if they find their account in it.</p>
                  <p>There's no man can blame the <hi>Scots</hi> for publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Declaration throughout the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the thing being abſolutely neceſſary in it ſelf, and the natural Practice of all new Settlements to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the World with the nature of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and on what Terms they may have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with them. We hope our Author and his Suborners will not ſay that the Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might not have traded with them for their own advantage, provided their Title had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable: and ſeeing the <hi>Scots</hi> had reaſon to think it ſo, it was no act of unkindneſs in them to let the Engliſh Plantations know that they ſhould be very welcome to trade to <hi>Darien;</hi> and how this could be done ſo properly, and with ſo much effect as by Declaration, our Author would do well to acquaint us.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman and his Friends are very angry that we ſhould have made uſe of the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi>'s Name to give the more Authority to the thing. We would very fain know their Reaſons, why it is not as lawful for the <hi>Scots</hi> to make uſe of that Name as the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and at the ſame time muſt take leave to tell the Renegado and his <hi>Whitehall</hi> Friends, that all this Venom they have ſpit at the Scots Colony is a virulent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective againſt his Majeſty. He impower'd them
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45975:97"/>to do what they accuſe them for by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: and becauſe our Antagoniſts have a mind to ſay that this <hi>Octroy,</hi> as they call it, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oblig'd to make an Excuſe for the King, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the honeſt Gentleman meant no harm at the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; for it is to be believ'd, that he could ſcarce bear what was whiſper'd for the noiſe of the</hi> Namur <hi>Guns,</hi> which is in plain Engliſh, he gave his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to he knew not what. A noble Defence, for which his Majeſty is oblig'd to them! But Banter and Blaſphemy they were fully reſolv'd on; and ſo they had but a Subject, they car'd not what. Nor <hi>Adam,</hi> nor <hi>David,</hi> nay nor the Almighty himſelf ſhall eſcape them; but his Commiſſion to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> when they departed out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> muſt come in to make up the profane Jeſt: thus Heav<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>H—s</hi> will needs inſiſt upon it in his Dedication, that our Project on <hi>Darien</hi> was ſo ſecretly carried on, that it was not known to <hi>England</hi> till the ſame Wind that brought the News likewiſe inform'd the Nation that the <hi>Scots</hi> were march'd over to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama,</hi> and had planted 80 Guns againſt it; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily forgets himſelf, and tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. of his Book that <hi>Paterſon</hi> communicated it to ſome ſelect Heads in <hi>England</hi> that were able to bear it. And we can tell him further, that it was ſo well known to ſome in <hi>England,</hi> that they ſent Capt. <hi>Long</hi> the Quaker on purpoſe to prevent us, and to do us all the miſchief he could; and accordingly he was on that Coaſt a month before us, tho he did not land any Men till afterwards. As for the news
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45975:97"/>of the <hi>Scots</hi> having planted 80 Cannon againſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama,</hi> it's the firſt time we ever heard on't, and therefore muſt charge it upon the Author amongſt the reſt of his Forgeries. There was indeed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port brought over by the <hi>Dutch Gazetts,</hi> which we ſuppoſe was inſerted on purpoſe by our good Friends in <hi>Holland</hi> to render us odious, that we had plundered <hi>Panama;</hi> but that was a long time after the news of our arrival at <hi>Darien,</hi> and fram'd on purpoſe, as we have reaſon to believe, to juſtify the Proclamations that ſome Gentlemen at the Weſt end of the Town had ſent to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> againſt us; for we know they can have what they pleaſe put in the <hi>Dutch Gazetts,</hi> and that perhaps may be one main reaſon why they have been altogether ſilent as to the matter in their own. But that which ſufficiently diſcovers the falſhood of this malicious Inſinuation, as if we had a deſign to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque <hi>Panama,</hi> or any other place belonging to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> is, Mr. <hi>Paterſon</hi>'s Letter to his Friend at <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> (and ſent us thence in print) dated at <hi>Fort St. Andrew</hi> in <hi>Caledonia,</hi> February 18. 1698/9. above fifteen weeks after the arrival of our Colony; wherein he acquaints that Gentleman, <hi>That they had written to the Preſident of</hi> Panama, <hi>giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him an account of our good and peaceable Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to procure a good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence.</hi>

We have but eight or nine Leagues to a River, where Boats may go into the South-Sea.

                                 <hi>The</hi> Spaniards, <hi>as we can underſtand, are very much ſurprized and alarm'd, and the more that it comes as a Thunder-clap upon them; having had no notice of us, until three days after our arrival.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45975:98"/>and Correſpondence; and if that is not condeſcended to, we are ready for what elſe he pleaſes.

We are here a thouſand one hundred Men, and expect Supplies every day.

                  <p>A farther proof of the Falſhood of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation is Capt. <hi>Pennicook</hi>'s Journal ſent to the Company over <hi>England,</hi> and dated <hi>Decem.</hi> 28th, almoſt two months before this Letter to <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> wherein they give an account of the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had from ſeveral hands, that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> were marching with 900 men from <hi>Panama</hi> to attacque them by Land, whilſt their Men of War were to attacque them by Sea; upon which they did all they could to put themſelves in a poſture of defence againſt them, ſo far were they from any deſign of marching towards <hi>Panama.</hi>

                  <p>The matter being ſo, <hi>H—s</hi>'s Suborners have loſt their Argument from this Topic alſo, to juſtify their proceedings againſt us.</p>
                  <p>He goes on to tell us, <hi>That</hi> England <hi>had no reaſon to go to War with the</hi> Spaniards <hi>on the ſcore of our Company, who beſides all the Loſs of their Trade, muſt throw away more</hi> Engliſh <hi>pounds (thrice over) than there</hi>'s Scotch <hi>in our Capital Stock; and he will leave it to any Man of half an ounce of Politicks to find out
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45975:99"/>the Jeſt on't, ſave this Hot-headed Author of our Colony's Defence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborners may pleaſe to know, that we neither deſir'd nor expected that <hi>England</hi> ſhould go to War with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our Company; and had as little reaſon to expect that a Faction in <hi>England</hi> (for we will not be ſo unjuſt as to charge it upon the Nation) ſhould go to War with us on account of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> before we could be heard in our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; we mean that Proclamations ſhould have been publiſh'd in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> inferring that the King of <hi>England</hi> has a power to declare that to be a breach of the Peace that is done by the Authority of the King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> that they ſhould thereby forbid their Subjects of <hi>England</hi> to entertain any Commerce with us, refuſe us Proviſions for Commodities in our diſtreſs, except we will bring our Ships under the Guns of their Fort at <hi>New-York;</hi> puniſh their Subjects for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Commerce with us, and threatning to lay the Commanders of our Ships in Irons if they offer to put in for Refreſhment, or to refit after a Storm, as they did to Capt. <hi>Jamiſon</hi> at <hi>Nevis.</hi> That this wants very little of going to War with the <hi>Scots,</hi> we believe moſt thinking men are very well ſatisfied; but whether it be ſo or not, we will venture to tell the Renegado and his Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that by this kind of Procedure againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> as if we were Servants and Subjects to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſome Gentlemen in and about <hi>White-hall</hi> have giv'n the <hi>Spaniards</hi> juſt occaſion to make War upon <hi>England</hi> if they were able, or at leaſt to make Repriſals upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the damage they pretend to have ſuffer'd from the <hi>Scots,</hi> whom the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court by this ſort of Treatment have declar'd to be their Subjects; whereas if they had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45975:99"/>not invaded the Soveraignty of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could have had no ſuch pretonce. Now whether men that had been endow'd with a quarter of an ounce of Politicks would have been guilty of ſuch a falſe ſtep as this, let our Author's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orners determine. And beſides, we muſt tell them, that the Men whom Capt. <hi>Long</hi> had ſet aſhore with Capt. <hi>Diego</hi> in the Gulph of <hi>Darien,</hi> committed the firſt Hoſtility on the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and kill'd ſeven of them, with a deſign, for any thing we know, to trapan us into a War with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> ſince one of the ſame Fellows came to our Colony afterwards for Powder and Shot, which our Men wiſely deny'd them, and told them they had done what they could not juſtify.</p>
                  <p>The Author of the Defence of the <hi>Scots</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dos no where adviſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to a War with <hi>Spain</hi> on the ſcore of our Company; but gives ſuch Arguments to prove that they had no reaſon to dread the Effects if <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould make War with them on that Account, and that it was the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to have ſupported the <hi>Scots</hi> in that Settlement, as have not yet been anſwer'd, and therefore we ſhall ſay nothing farther of it here.</p>
                  <p>Our Author and his Friends are pleas'd to call our apprechenſions of the Places being poſſeſs'd by the <hi>French</hi> bugbear Stories, becauſe the <hi>French</hi> have another Game to play at preſent with <hi>Spain,</hi> or might have ſecur'd <hi>Carthagena</hi> when they had it in their Power; and that if <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> had any ſuch deſign, they may go ſit down within a League of either ſide of our Colony with as good a Title as ours.</p>
                  <p>But that the <hi>French</hi> are genetally wiſer than to lay out their Mony upon ſuch Tools as this Author appears to be by his way of argning, one would
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45975:100"/>be apt to think he had touch'd ſome <hi>Leuidor's.</hi> Does he conceive that the <hi>French</hi> underſtood their Intereſt ſo little during the War that threatned their Ruine, as to ſettle a Colony in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> at a time when they ſtood in more need of them at home to defend their own Country, and cultivate their Ground and Vineyards? Is it not known that their Deſign was on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plate, in order to enable them to continue the War, and not on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plantations, which they were in no Capacity to defend againſt the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and their Allies if they had at that time ſeiz'd any of them? Does our Author and his Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners think that <hi>L.</hi> XIV. did not underſtand his Intereſt better than to offer at a Settlement in the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies,</hi> eſpecially at a place of ſuch Importance as <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and thereby have give the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> an opportunity of ſettling there themſelves by coming to drive him out? Could he think that the two Nations of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> that have the greateſt Naval Force, and were moſt concern'd of any to reduce him to reaſon, would ſit ſtill and ſuffer him to ſeize the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Treafures, and by that means enable himſelf to bring all <hi>Europe</hi> under his Yoke? It is impoſſible ſuch a thought could ever enter into his mind; and therefore he had very good reaſon to forbear keeping poſſeſſion of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> ſince 'twould have been the ready way to have ſpoil'd his future pretenſions to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> in caſe of the K. of <hi>Spain</hi>'s death, which every body then expected daily. And whenever it happens, if he die without Iſſue, as there's great odds he will, we ſtand in need of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Guarantees than <hi>H—</hi> and his Suborners, that the <hi>Fr.</hi> King will not ſeize the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies</hi> and <hi>Darien</hi> into Boot; againſt which there are
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45975:100"/>thoſe who have ſtudied Politicks as much as our Author, who are of opinion that the Settlement at <hi>Darien</hi> might have been no contemptible Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier.</p>
                  <p>The Scribler takes upon him to pafs his word for his Majeſty that the <hi>Scots</hi> Crown will receive no blemiſh or diſreputation by his wearing it. We believe his Majeſty will ſcarcely thank him for his Security, and we are ſatisfied our Nation will as little rely on it. But at the ſame time we muſt tell this Gentleman and his Suborners, that we had as little reaſon to ſuſpect that K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. who was a Native of <hi>Scotland,</hi> would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour'd our Crown ſo far as to order it to be brought to <hi>England;</hi> and therefore it is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fible for Princes to be over-perſwaded by ill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to do ſuch things as are inconſiſtent with the Honour of their Crowns. And thus ſome will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, that the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> was no ways honour'd, when the <hi>Dutch</hi> Troops took place of the King of <hi>Scots</hi>'s Guards; and when the King of <hi>England</hi> takes upon him to condemn by Proclamations what the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by Act of Parliament and Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                  <p>The Scribler comes next to give us a taſte of his Skill in the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Hiſtory he brags of ſo much, by telling us the Fate of ſome great <hi>Scots</hi> Families that ſwell'd beyond their Proportion. His Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Cummins</hi> and <hi>Gouries</hi> ſufficiently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Ignorance of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Hiſtory. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was indeed a very great Family, but are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auſpicious inſtance for him and thoſe of his kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, their ruin not being occaſion'd by their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but by joying with the Enemies of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this Renegado does.</p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:45975:101"/>
                  <p>As for his Application of his Inſtances, it ſerves to diſcover the malicious Deſigns of himſelf and Suborners againſt the two greateſt Families that are now left in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The kind treatment this Author met with from one of theſe great Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his arrival, after having deſerted our Colony, would have oblig'd any but a Monſter of Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to have forborn ſuch a cauſeleſs and invenom'd Reflection, which nothing but ingrain'd Malice can ſuggeſt.</p>
                  <p>We come in the next place to take a view of the Book it ſelf. In the very firſt Page he owns <hi>he is no Friend to the</hi> Scots <hi>Company, and alledges he has more reaſon for it than thoſe Skeletons that are ſtarved to death.</hi> This we hope is ſufficient to ſhew what credit is to be given to his Narrative, wherein tho he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to keep cloſe to matter of Fact, he abounds with blaſphemous and impertinent Digreſſions: One of the firſt we ſhall take notice of, is his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly Reflection on the City of <hi>London,</hi> pag. 3. <hi>as a place where Matter is never wanting to exerciſe plodding Heads.</hi> Which is ſo near a kin to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Faction that in the late Reigns aim'd at the deſtruction of that Noble Emporium, which deſerves to be the Miſtreſs of the Univerſe, that we cannot in the leaſt doubt but it proceeds from the ſame Spirit. Of the ſame nature is his reflection, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. upon the <hi>London</hi> Subſcribers, who came in ſo faſt to the <hi>Scots</hi> Company, <hi>that he thought himſelf the happieſt man that could get his Name firſt down in our Books:</hi> Which is a plain demonſtration that thoſe eager Subſcribers thought the Deſign no way prejudicial to the Intereſt of their Country; for upon enquiry it will be found, that moſt of them were ſuch as had zealouſly appear'd for its Liberty in former Reigns.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:45975:101"/>
                  <p>His malicious Reflection in that ſame Page, as if the Company had promis'd 20000 <hi>l</hi> to <hi>Paterſon, Smith,</hi> and <hi>Lodg,</hi> to engage Subſcriptions in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the <hi>Hans</hi>-Towns, is notoriouſly falſe: they had not one Farthing promis'd them, tho to be ſure the Company would have rewarded them for their Pains and Service, as it was reaſonable they ſhould; beſides, it appears by the eagerneſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hamburgers</hi> to ſubſcribe, until they were prevented by their reſpective Governments, that there was no occaſion for ſuch a Bribe to bring in Subſcriptions.</p>
                  <p>His Reflection, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. of our printing the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of the Commons at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but not the King's Anſwer, admitting it to be true, is ſo far from being criminal, that it rather argues the greateſt reſpect imaginable for his Majeſty, whom we would not leſſen in the eſteem of the People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who knew they had a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right to claim and expect his Protection. His owning in that ſame Page, that the Company's Books had not been long open'd in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> till 400000 <hi>l</hi> was ſign'd, and that all ſorts of People (whom he is pleas'd to expreſs under the ſcurrilous denomination of poor, blind and lame) crouded in with their Subſcriptions, ſerves to confute his foregoing and following Reflections, <hi>That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was obliged to promiſe</hi> 20000 <hi>l</hi> to procure Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and to go where the Money lay, viz. <hi>to</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and the</hi> Hans-<hi>Towns;</hi> eſpecially ſince he owns himſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 10, 19. That <hi>they were baulk'd of their Subſcriptions in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Holland, <hi>and had not one Groat of the</hi> Hamburgers <hi>Money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Reflection upon Mr. <hi>Paterſon,</hi> pag, 8. whom he blaſphemouſly calls <hi>the Man Paterſon,</hi> alluding to the Apoſtles calling our Saviour <hi>the Man Chriſts,</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:45975:102"/>is altogether falſe: he always propos'd the paying half the Subſcriptions, and moſt of the Subſcribers were reſolved to pay the whole; as it appears they have already a conſiderable part of it, by their having ſent away three Convoys, and being buſy in preparing a fourth. His Irreligious and Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical temper appears further by his reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their expecting good Returns by the <hi>old Cant of God's Bleſſing,</hi> as if it were poſſible to look for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in any thing without the Divine Benediction, or ridiculous to expreſs our dependency on it. But it ſeems his Suborners are reſolv'd that our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be huff'd, banter'd, and blaſphem'd out of all their Rights as Men and Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>His next Reflection, <hi>p.</hi> 9. of our ſending Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to build ſix Ships of fifty Guns apiece at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> to prepoſſeſs the <hi>Dutchmen</hi> with a kind opinion of the Company, and thereby make it appear how willing we were to extend the warm Rays of our Octroy to people who deſerv'd it better than our ungrateful Neighbours, is mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the higheſt degree. He and his Suborners very well know, that we could neither build nor buy in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe of the oppoſition made to us there; and ſince 'tis known that they can build cheaper in <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> than in <hi>England,</hi> our offering firſt to lay out our Money with our Neighbours, and not going beyond Sea till we were compell'd to it, is a proof from his own Mouth, that we had no other but friendly Intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>His Inſinuation of the Difference betwixt the Kirk and Church Parties, about each of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying their own Inſtruments, ſhews more Malice than Wiſdom; ſince admitting People of different Perſwaſions into Companies is practiſed in all trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45975:102"/>parts of the World, and particularly in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where the Diſſenters have no ſmall ſhare in all their Funds and Companies: but by this they may ſee what fair Treatment they are to expect, if <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborners could get their wills. The old Popiſh Maxim would ſoon be brought into practice, that no man ſhould have Leave to buy or ſell, but he that is of the public Religion.</p>
                  <p>His next Story of our Debate about entruſting any man that was fed on <hi>Engliſh</hi> Beef and Pudding with 20000 <hi>l</hi> for the uſe of our Delegates abroad, is equally ſcurrilous and falſe. We truſted no man but Mr. <hi>Paterſon</hi> with that Money, and did not think it ſit that every Subſcriber, but that only a ſpecial Committee ſhould know how that Money was to be imploy'd. Nor can this be charg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us as a piece of fooliſh Confidence in Mr. <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> whom the Scribler owns <hi>P.</hi> 4. to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with laying the Foundation of the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> tho ill rewarded for it. His malicious Calumny, that Mr. <hi>Paterſon</hi> did afterwards form the <hi>Darien</hi> Project to be reveng'd on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is ſufficiently falſified by his and our firſt Offers to take in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as joint Subſcribers, after the ſaid Project was actually form'd, and imparted to ſome ſelect Heads, as he himſelf owns <hi>P.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Smith</hi>'s cheating us of 8500 it was our Misfortune, not our Crime, as is manifeſt from our Diligence in recovering 4500 <hi>l</hi> of it. This Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's ſaying <hi>P.</hi> 11. that <hi>Smith</hi> deſervedly bubled us, argues himſelf to be as great a Cheat as <hi>Smith;</hi> and there's little reaſon to doubt, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded the Company as far as opportunity would allow him, when intruſted as Purſer with their Stores from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and elſewhere, which he ſeems to own himſelf when he boaſts of his bringing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45975:103"/>home as much Gold-duſt from <hi>Darien,</hi> as any of the Counſellors, <hi>P.</hi> 149.</p>
                  <p>His Aſſertion <hi>P.</hi> 14. that Capt. <hi>Gibſon</hi> was cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the 2 <hi>per Cent</hi> Commiſſion Money, is a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Falſhood; the Captain was ſatisfied, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded to his own content.</p>
                  <p>The next proof we have of the Ingenuity of this Renegado and his Suborners, is <hi>P.</hi> 15. where he tells us that <hi>Paterſon</hi> being in Drink, babbled out a Secret of the Company at <hi>Camphire,</hi> viz. <hi>That their Act empowered them to give Commiſſions to any kind of People (without asking their Nation) to trade to the</hi> Indies <hi>under</hi> Scots <hi>Colours; and that ſuch People might diſpoſe of their</hi> India <hi>Goods where they pleas'd, providing they made a ſham Entry in</hi> Scotland. To ſay that this was a <hi>Secret of the Company,</hi> and in the ſame breath to inform the World that Mr. <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſaid, <hi>they were impowered to do ſo by their Act,</hi> which was every where publick, and in print, is like the reſt of the Libeller's Inconſiſtencies: But his Suborners and he were ſo far tranſported with Malice, that they reſolv'd to dreſs our Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament throughout in the diſguiſe of a Cheat, and charge it upon the Company as ſecret Intrigues, without ever conſidering that the Act it ſelf would diſcover their Falſhood and Malice. The Clauſe of the Act is as follows: <q>And that the ſaid Company may, by virtue hereof, grant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate ſuch Rights, Properties, Powers and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and permit and allow ſuch ſort of Trade, Commerce, and Navigation into their Plantations, Colonies, Cities, Towns, or Places of their Poſſeſſion, as the ſaid Company ſhall from time to time judg ſit and convenient.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe being the very words of the Act, the <hi>Dutch</hi> could not be impos'd upon in that manner by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45975:103"/>Mr. <hi>Paterſon,</hi> if he had been ſo minded; or had he been drunk, as the Libeller ſays, when he told the ſtory, they muſt have been very weak men, that would offer to ſign upon the words of a drunken man, without ſeeing the Act it ſelf. It is not to be doubted but this Clauſe impowers the Company to allow ſuch a Trade as <hi>H—s</hi> mentions; and therefore it might be proper enough for Mr. <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to urge it as an Argument to engage Subſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: but that he could do it in theſe Terms that <hi>H—s</hi> here ſets down, there's no ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and therefore his Anſwer to thoſe that would not ſign but on that bottom, <hi>that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had no occaſion to make uſe of that Power at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> was very proper. The Story of the ſham Entry in <hi>Scotland,</hi> paying 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and thereby underſelling the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> 17 <hi>per Cent.</hi> is ſo void of all ſenſe, that it would ſeem the Libeller and his Suborners were drunk when they ſuggeſted it. The Act does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed oblige ſuch Ships as were imploy'd by the Company to break bulk in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but lays no ſuch Obligation upon thoſe that they might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power to trade to their Colony: And conſidering what has been already ſaid of the Drawbacks, that the Cargo of the ſaid Ships was Cuſtom-free no where but in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion they were to pay 3 <hi>per Cent.</hi> at leaſt to the Company, how was it poſſible they could underſel the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> 17 <hi>per Cent.</hi> eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the vaſt Quantities that thoſe two Companies buy at a time, and by conſequence were like to have the prime Coſt eaſier than our Infant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany?</p>
                  <p>After all this ſham Story, he happens to tell the main reaſon of the Miſcarriage of our Deſign in

                     <hi>Holland</hi> and perhaps of its doing ſo in <hi>England. The</hi> Dutch Eaſt <hi>and</hi> Weſt India <hi>Companies,</hi> ſays he, <hi>complain'd to the Lords of</hi> Amſterdam <hi>that the</hi> Scots <hi>Commiſſioners were deſigning the ruin of their Trade.</hi> Which by the way ſhews that the Project of an <hi>American</hi> Trade was diſcours'd of by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners; which the Libeller, it's probable, would not have mention'd, had not his Memory given him the ſlip, and that he forgot he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly told us that the <hi>Darien</hi> Project was ſtill kept ſecret. Why then ſhould the <hi>Dutch Weſt-India</hi> Company be ſo much concerned at our taking Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions there, but that they knew we had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign on the Iſthmus of <hi>America?</hi> and therefore their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company knowing alſo, that we being once Maſters of a good Settlement there, it would have abridg'd the way, and made Voyages ſpeedier to <hi>China, Japan,</hi> the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where their Trade lies, they thought it might in time be dangerous for them, if that <hi>Iſthmus</hi> ſhould be poſſeſs'd by the Subjects of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> So that there's no reaſon to doubt but they found Intereſt enough at the Weſt end of the Town to lay as many rubs in our way as was poſſible to be done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P.</hi> 17. The Libellers give us another Evidence of their Candor and Ingenuity, when they tell us, <q>The <hi>Hamburghers</hi> knew nothing of <hi>Darien,</hi> but builded altogether on Ships laden with <hi>India</hi> Goods, whereof their City and Port was to be the Receptacle and Mart, whilſt <hi>Paterſon</hi> wanted only Mony to raiſe Forces to overrun <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru.</hi>
                     </q> But our Author and his Suborners ought to have conſider'd, that ſince they have told us of the Fears of the <hi>Dutch Weſt-India</hi> Company, we could eaſily infer, that the Project of the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> could not be long conceal'd from the <hi>Hamburghers:</hi> That the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45975:104"/>Act it ſelf would ſatisfy the Subſcribers there, that the Company's Ships muſt break bulk in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and therefore they could not expect to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle and Mart of our Stores: whatever they might hope for as to conveying the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize to the Inland Places of <hi>Germany,</hi> they could not but think that we had Shipping of our own to carry our Goods to the Ports on the <hi>Baltick</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Sea.</p>
                  <p>In that ſame Page they give us another hint to confirm our Suſpicion that it is more from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of our leſſening the <hi>Dutch</hi> than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, that the Court have ſo violently oppos'd us, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>that the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> by joining with the <hi>Scots</hi> had a proſpect of worming the <hi>Hollander</hi> out of a good part of the <hi>German</hi> Trade.</q> Which admitting to be true, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had none but themſelves to blame for it, ſince we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to take them in as joint Subſcribers before we made any Propoſal to the <hi>Hamburghers;</hi> nor is it any ways unreaſonable in it ſelf that <hi>Germans</hi> ſhould have the preference of other Nations in trading with <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After a great deal of prophane Banter and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculing the ſacred Text, he tells us that the Human Reaſon of our Diſappointment was an unneceſſary Paragraph in our <hi>Octroy, which occaſion'd a great many</hi> Engliſh <hi>and</hi> Holland <hi>Speculations,</hi> viz. <hi>That in caſe the Company ſhould be interrupted in their Trade,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the King had ingaged to interpoſe the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to do them right, and that at the public Charge;</hi> which, ſays he, <hi>Paterſon</hi> and the reſt inſinuated in all Companies; <hi>That the King was to aſſist and defend them with his Ships of War, or otherwiſe, if there was occaſion, and that out of his own Pocket, which they did not question to be</hi> Engliſh <hi>Coin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:45975:105"/>
                  <p>There's no reaſonable Man will think it unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that a Prince ſhould protect his Subjects in their Trade, either by his Men of War or otherwiſe; and therefore this being a Clauſe of the Act of Parliament, it was no ways unneceſſary to be put into the Patent: and we will adventure to tell <hi>H—</hi> and his Suborners that they who advis'd his Majeſty to refuſe our Company the three Men of War built at our own Charge, when they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to be at the expence of maintaining them, have advis'd him to act contrary to the Truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in him as King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and to contravene this very Act of Parliament, and that which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd thoſe Ships to be built for defence of Trade; than which there cannot be a more falſe ſtep in Government: for when once People perceive that Princes have no regard to the Laws made for the protection and welfare of the Subject, they will naturally think themſelves abſolv'd from ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their Allegiance, and ſupport of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. That Mr. <hi>Paterſon,</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould inſinuate from the <hi>Octroy</hi> that we were to be aſſiſted or defended by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men of War or Money, is nothing but a mixture of Falſhood and Malice. The Libeller owns that the Words of our Act cannot bear it, and the World knows that our Parliaments never pretend to diſpoſe of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Ships or Mony; and therefore no man of ſenſe will believe this Renegado, when he ſays the <hi>Scots</hi> Company put that Gloſs on the Text for their own advantage, ſince that had been directly to expoſe themſelves. For we are not to ſuppoſe they could think the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Hamburghers</hi> ſo weak, as not to peruſe the Act it ſelf, which would ſoon have undeceived them: Therefore all thoſe Reflections, which he protends the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Traders to <hi>India</hi>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:45975:105"/>made upon it, muſt vaniſh of courſe, as having no manner of Foundation.</p>
                  <p>Much leſs can they ſerve to juſtify the Memorial given in at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> by Sir <hi>Paul Ricaut</hi> againſt our taking Subſcriptions there: Which Memorial, tho minc'd by our Libeller, yet ev'n as he repreſents it, is againſt the Law of Nations, and indeed ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconcileable to good ſenſe; in the firſt place to call our Agents private Men, who acted by the Company's Authority, and according to Act of Parliament; and in the next place to ſuppoſe that the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> could poſſibly join with us in hopes of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Protection, when the Oppoſition made to us by the Court of <hi>England</hi> was known all over <hi>Europe:</hi> nay the Scribler himſelf owns, <hi>P.</hi> 17. <hi>That the more Oppoſition the</hi> Engliſh <hi>and</hi> Dutch <hi>offer'd to the Project, the more the</hi> Hamburghers <hi>thought it their Interest to embrace it.</hi> This is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Suborners that the next time they hire a Scribler to belie the <hi>Scots</hi> Company, they muſt be ſure to pitch upon one that has a better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
                  <p>His next Reflections <hi>P.</hi> 22, 23. <hi>That our Ships were neither fit for Trade nor War, that our Cargo was not proper, that our main Deſign was the Buccaneer Trade, that above</hi> 10000 l. <hi>was deficient of the firſt Payments, and most of the Subſcribers not able to raiſe their</hi> Quota, are equally falſe with the reſt. The Ships for their Burden and Size, are as fit either for Trade or War as any in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Cargo of Cloth, Stuffs, Shoes, Stockins, Slippers, and Wigs, muſt needs be proper for a Country where the Natives go naked for want of Apparel, and fit to be exchanged for other Commodities, either in the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch, French,</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plantations.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45975:106"/>For Bibles we ſuppoſe our Libeller would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we had carried Maſs Books; yet others will be of opinion, that 1500 of 'em was no unfit Cargo: Our own Colony might have diſpens'd with that number in a little time; nor were they unfit to have been put into the hands of ſuch of the Natives, eſpecially of the younger ſort, that might learn our language. For Hoes, Axes, Macheet Knives, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> they were abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for our ſelves, and a Commodity much valued by the Natives. Fifteen hundred ſquare Buccaneer Pieces, and proportionable Ammunition, was no ſuch extraordinary Store for eleven or twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men: and whereas he maliciouſly inſinuates that Buccaneering was our main Deſign, the Event hath prov'd it to be falſe; had that been our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, we might eaſily have invaded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plantations at both ends of the <hi>Iſthmus; Sancta Maria,</hi> nor <hi>Panama</hi> it ſelf, could never have been able to withſtand ſuch a force, when a few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplin'd Buccaneers did ſo eaſily take them. It's well enough known there was a parcel of as brave Men that went with our Fleet as perhaps <hi>Great Britain</hi> could afford, many of 'em inur'd to War and Fatigues, and knew how to look an Enemy in the Face without being daunted. They had giv'n proofs enough of that in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where no men alive could fight with more Bravery and Zeal than they did for the Common Cauſe, tho ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſince thought ſit to ſtarve them. That there was above 10000 <hi>l</hi> of the 100000 <hi>l</hi> not paid in, is falſe; there was not above 2000 <hi>l</hi> wanting. For thoſe great men that thought their Countenance enough, and therefore refus'd to pay in their Subſcriptions, he ſhall have our leave to name
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45975:106"/>them; but perhaps his Suborners will not care to have their Friends ſo much expos'd. That moſt of the Subſcribers were unable to raiſe their <hi>Quota,</hi> is demonſtrably falſe, by our ſending away two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys ſince, the thirds being greater by far than the firſt, and that we are now preparing a fourth. As to the Companies charging 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> advance on every Article of the 19000 <hi>l</hi> Stock, it's well enough known that ſo much Advance is thought nothing in a <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade; it was all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. the Company was to have, and only charged in the Books by way of Formality, that the Colony might know what they were indebted to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>His Story, <hi>p. 23.</hi> of its being propos'd in the Company <hi>to ſell off their Ships and Cargo, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Product amongſt the Subſcribers,</hi> is nothing eul our diſhonour, nor at all to be wondred at, conſidering the unreaſonable oppoſition we had met with from Court. That <hi>we rejected it as inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> argues ſtill that we are not ſo mean-ſpirited as he elſewhere repreſents us. His baſe Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>p.</hi> 24. on the Company, as if they had deſpair'd of the deſign, and ſent their men to Sea on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to periſh; and on <hi>Drummellier, that be order'd the Colony to get Mony honeſtly if they could, but be ſure to get it; and if they came home without it, then the Devil get them all,</hi> ſerve only to diſcover his own Temper, and that he thinks all men act and ſpeak like himſelf. We have faid enough already to demonſtrate the Honeſty of both Company and Colony: Had their deſign been to get: Mony with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to Honeſty, they would not have been ſtarv'd to death by the Proclamations, and other oppoſition made them at Court; they could quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45975:107"/>have poſſeſſed themſelves of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mines, which the Scribler owns, <hi>p.</hi> 164. were within twelve Leagues of them, and with much more eaſe of the 40000 <hi>l</hi> that was ſunk in the <hi>French</hi> Ship. But he ſerves the Suborners for their Mony much at the ſame rate he did the <hi>Scots</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                  <p>His Reflection <hi>p.</hi> 25. that Mr. <hi>Stratford</hi> was oblig'd to arreſt our Ships at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> for 800 <hi>l Flemiſh,</hi> as they were fitting out, ſerves only to diſcover his own malice and folly; Mr. <hi>Stratford</hi> had very good Security for 800 <hi>l Flemiſh</hi> when he had four Ships in Port not yet fitted out; and his receiving his Mony in a fortnight or three weeks, as the Libeller owns in the ſame Paragraph, ſhows he had no ill Paymaſters to deal with. It were well for <hi>England</hi> if all thoſe that have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Royal Navy could ſay as much by his Suborners and their Friends. As for our diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Stratford</hi> to be any longer our Caſhier, there's no need of aſſigning any other Cauſe for it, but that Sr. <hi>Paul Ricaut</hi>'s Memorial render'd it needleſs; and to that ſame account we muſt charge the two Ships that were left there to rot in their Ouſe. But at the ſame time we will tell him we had no great reaſon to be ſatisfied with Mr. <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s Conduct, and believe we have leſs now than ever ſince this Libeller defends him.</p>
                  <p>His Story <hi>p.</hi> 26 of Mr, <hi>Henderſon's</hi> arreſting another of our Ships for 3000 <hi>l</hi> is ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd by himſelf, when he tells us, that he and his Partners fail'd in their Subſcriptions, which was a juſt debt due to the Company, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had reaſon to demand and expect it, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially he being a <hi>Scots</hi>-man: yet the Company
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45975:107"/>dealt very kindly with him on that account; and ſo much the more, that they conſider'd his being a Reſidenter in <hi>Holland,</hi> where he was liable both to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Court, to whoſe account the Libeller muſt alſo charge this Affront, and the Loſs we ſuſtain'd at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What he ſays of our Seamen, <hi>p.</hi> 27, 28. is a manifeſt untruth. They were immediately paid, extreamly well ſatisfied; and we had ſuch choice of able Seamen who were willing to go in the Expedition, that we turn'd feveral aſhoar after they had embarqu'd, as having no occaſion for them. As to his Reflection on Mr. <hi>Robert Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> for pinching them of their Wages, and <hi>p.</hi> 46. for cheating them as to their Proviſions; that Gentleman is now at <hi>London,</hi> where we leave <hi>H—s</hi> and him to account for it. We doubt not but Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi> may have Juſtice done him in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-hall</hi> if he thinks ſit to ſue for it; but ſo much we think our ſelves oblig'd to ſay in his Vindication during his abſence, that he was never charg'd with any ſuch thing by the Company.</p>
                  <p>His next Reflections on the Transfer, <hi>p. 29.</hi> by which he would impoſe on the World as if it had been a Trick of the Company to cheat the seamen of their Wages, are ſo much the leſs to be credited, that he himſelf is a Party, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd the Suit he talks of in <hi>Doctors Commons;</hi> which tho that Court may perhaps have determin'd in his favour, becauſe the Bargain was made with him in <hi>London,</hi> and thoſe that made it were on the Spot, and for other Cauſes beſt known to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it is nothing at all to the matter in hand; our Courts have no reaſon to take them for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and our Company has as little to allow the Libeller any Wages.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:45975:108"/>
                  <p>But to come to the Transfer, which he ſo foully miſrepreſents. It was ſo far from being a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine practice, that it was agreed on in publick Council, and but highly reaſonable that the Colony ſhould be accountable to the Company for the Stock they intruſted them with. The Libeller on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betrays his own Folly and Malice, and impoſes upon his Suborners, when he ſays the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who gave their joint Bond to the Company for 70000 <hi>l</hi> were not worth ſo many Engliſh Pence; for, admitting they had not been worth one penny of perſonal Eſtate, they were intruſted by the Company with 19000 <hi>l</hi> Cargo, and Ships, Proviſions, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> to make it up 70000 <hi>l</hi> which was not charg'd upon them as their perſonal Debt, but upon the Colony as a Corporation, till the ſame was paid. What he ſays as to the Seamen is a malicious Untruth. It was indeed agreed that the Colony ſhould pay them; but if they did not, the Company was to do it: and beſides, the two months advance which the Libeller owns was paid them, the Company was to pay to them, or to thoſe that had their Powers, or Letters of Attorny, a Month in ſix, and have accordingly paid them. As to the Seamens being made believe that aſſoon as they had ſet the Landmen on ſhoar, they were to proceed on a trading Voyage, and return to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to be paid, it is equally falſe, they being to ſtay out whilſt the Company pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>Then as to the Transfer in general, it was ſo far from being clandeſtine, or a Trick, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was impower'd to make it by the Act of Parliament which gave them their Original, as any Perſon may ſee by turning to the Act it ſelf,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45975:108"/>which authorizes them to <hi>transfer their joint Stock, or Capital Fund, or any Eſtate real or perſonal, Ships, Goods, &amp;c. belonging to the Company, under ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, Rules, Conditions, &amp;c. as the ſaid Company ſhall by writing in and upon their Books,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Landmen, whom he will alſo have to be impos'd upon, they knew what they had to relic on, and were very well ſatisfied with it; and as to the Companys levying Souldiers under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Planters, without asking leave of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Council, admitting it to be true, they are not at all to be blam'd for it, ſince they had no reaſon to think that the Faction at Court, which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traven'd Acts of Parliament by oppoſing their Subſcriptions, and denying them the men of War built for the protection of our Trade, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to levy Souldiers under that Name. But the truth of the matter is this, they were really deſign'd for' Planters, and not at all for Military Buſineſs; tho it was highly neceſſary the Colony ſhould have as many Officers and diſciplin'd Men as they could, that they might be the more able to defend themſelves in caſe of Attaque: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his railing againſt the Colony for offering to puniſh Deſerters and other Criminals, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovers his own ignorance and malice; for by the Act of Parliament they had the whole Power, Civil and Military, conferr'd upon them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly might exerciſe their Power upon all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons belonging to the Company as they ſaw cauſe ſo that this is again a libelling of the Act of Parliament thro the Company's ſides.</p>
                  <p>His Repreſentation of the ſeven Men choſen for Counſellors, <hi>page</hi> 34. is falſe and malicious to the higheſt degree. The liberty given to add other
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45975:109"/>ſix to thoſe ſeven, was not, as he ſpitefully inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates, for <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> men of Subſtance that ſhould join them from the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but for ſuch of their own number as they might think fit to aſſume afterwards. It cannot once enter into the thoughts of any man of ſenſe, that the Colony ſhould at firſt entruſt Foreigners, and eſpecially <hi>French</hi> Papiſts in their Government, or that the Company had any deſign they ſhould do ſo; but he and his Suborners think it their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to make us odious to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> by accuſing us of a deſign to drain their Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
                  <p>As to Mr. <hi>Paterſon,</hi> whom he hath all along a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd he happens now thro Inadvertency to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate him from his own Calumnies; he formerly charg'd him as being Partner with <hi>Smith</hi> in cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Company of 8500 <hi>l</hi> and now he tells us that Mr. <hi>Paterſon</hi> was brought to this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either to go aboard the Fleet bound for <hi>Caledonia</hi> as a Volunteer, or to go to Priſon at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for Debt; which, had he cheated the Company of ſo much Mony as this Libeller pretends there had been no occaſionfor, he might have paid his Debts, and gone where he would: and beſides, the Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler vindicates the Company at the ſame time from his former Charge of their being bewitch'd by <hi>Paterſon</hi>'s golden Dreams &amp;<hi>c.</hi> for had they relied ſo much upon him as the Libeller alledges, they would never have ſhew'd that indifference for him which here he ridicules him with. Such has been the hard Fate of the Suborners, that their Tool has not the ſenſe to make his Evidence conſiſtent, but every where cuts his own Throat by Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions.</p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:45975:109"/>
                  <p>To ſum up the Matter according to the Libeller's own Evidence. In the Council there were ſome Men of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that had been bred to the Sword and the Law, others had been Officers both by Sea and Land, and ſome that had gain'd Experience in Merchandizing, and ſeveral Trades.</p>
                  <p>His Banter on the death of the Miniſters and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous abuſe of Scripture, <hi>P.</hi> 37. ſmell ſo rank of the Atheiſt and Libertine, and do ſo evidently prove that he hath loſt all ſenſe of Humanity and Religion, that we are ſarisſied it will do his Maſters and their Cauſe more hurt than Service; and therefore we paſs it over.</p>
                  <p>The next Proof we have of his Falſhood and Malice, is his long Story about Mr. <hi>Wafer,</hi> from <hi>Page</hi> 38 to 45, wherein he does ſo blend Truth with Falſhood, as ſhews he had a mind at any rate to beſpatter the Reputation of the Committee of the Company: the ſaid Commitree knew nothing of thoſe Gentlemers treating with <hi>Wafer</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> till they acquainted them with it, and it was only upon their Recommendation that they ſent for him: As to their Collecting any Guineas at <hi>Pontack's</hi> for Mr. <hi>Wafer,</hi> it is altogether falſe. The Articles were drawn by Mr. <hi>James Campbel</hi> the Merchant, now in <hi>London,</hi> and wrote by Mr. <hi>Fitz Gerald</hi> an Iriſh Merchant, who both can reſtify that this Matter is foully miſrepreſented; for Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> had an Alternative propos'd to him, which he agreed to, <hi>viz.</hi> to have ſo much if the Company thought ſit to imploy him, and ſo much for his trouble and pains if they did not; the Company was ſo far from ſtanding in any need of his Book, that they had a Manuſcript of it before ever they ſaw him, which was altogether unknown to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that treated with him at <hi>London</hi> this he himſelf knows to be true, and that to his no ſmall ſurprize, they repeared ſeveral Paſſages out of it to him, and indeed the Manuſcript is more particular than his Book, whatever Cauſe he hath ſince had to make any Alterations in it we know not. The Company upon the whole, finding that he could inform them of no thing conſiderable more than what was in the Manuſcript, and that he could do them no great Service, left him at his Liberty to publiſh his Book when he pleas'd, gave him about 100 <hi>l</hi> firſt and laſt for his Pains and Expence, with which he was very well

As to the Libeller's malicious Inſinuation that they had no further Service for him when once he had diſcovered the place where the <hi>Nicaragua-Wood</hi> grew, It is abſolutely falſe, for the Manuſcript they had was very particular in that. This Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi> knows to be true, and if he have but a juſt reſentment, he is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd to vindicate himſelf; for, the Libeller reflects as much upon him as upon the Company, when he charges him with putting a Cheat upon them, as to their <hi>Nicaragua-Wood, P.</hi> 44. which <hi>H—s</hi> ſays he and others went in ſearch of for ſeveral Miles along the Coaſt, but could find none; and yet he magnifies <hi>Wafer</hi>'s Freedom, and being ingenious by informing them ſo particularly, as to the place where the <hi>Nicaragua-Wood</hi> grew,<hi>P.</hi> 41. So perpetually does this malicious Libeller contradict himſelf.—As to the other parts of his Story of Mr. <hi>Wafers</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd near <hi>Haddington,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> it was no more than what Prudence would have directed any Men to do in the like Circumſtances: the Company not knowing till after having diſcours'd him whether he could do them any Service or not; it was not their Wiſdom to expoſe him to publick View; and having found that he could not ſerve them, it was equally prudent in them to keep him at an uncertainty as to their deſign; they being under no obligation to acquaint him with it. As to the Story of Admiral <hi>Bembo</hi>'s waiting their motion; if they did ſay ſo, the Event hath made it but too probable; he hath waited ſo long in thoſe Parts till our Colony hath left <hi>Darien:</hi> what Orders he had concerning it, or what Part he hath acted in it, Time muſt determine; but if all that we have heard of large Bills being return'd him, and of his Offers by his Sloops to draw our Men from our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony be true, there's reaſon to ſuſpect that he was ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with no deſign for our advantage: However that may be we know not; but this we know, that if our Enemies at Court had been as zealous to protect us as they have been to ruin us, the Admiral would certainly have had Orders to have made Repriſals on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for detaining
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45975:110"/>Capt. <hi>Pincarton</hi> his Ship and Men, contrary to Treary with the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> when forc'd a-ſhoar by a Storm under the Walls of <hi>Carthagena.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He tells us,<hi>P.</hi> 45, <q>That two thirds of the Proviſion were ſpent e're the Fleet ſail'd, that there was none to be had in <hi>Scotland</hi> at that time, and if there had, there was no Money; the 100000 <hi>l</hi> being ſunk, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's Credit not worth 2 <hi>d.</hi> and that they had ſtuck there, had it not been for ſome few Pillars of the <hi>Scots</hi> Company who mortgag'd their Eſtates; for which the Company made over three of their Ships to them for their Security.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there was no Proviſions to be had then in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> will seadily be allow'd him, is ſufficient to anſwer all his malicious Clamour againſt the Company, and to confute his own Objection, <hi>P.</hi> 155. in defence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, againſt the Company, for not ſending them Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. That there was no Money, and that the Company's Credit was not worth 2 <hi>d.</hi> is confuted by himſelf, when he owns that a few of the Pillats rais'd 5000 <hi>l</hi> and took three of the Company's Ships for Security. For that a few of the Pillars could raiſe 5000 <hi>l</hi> and the Company have three new Ships, one of them of 70 Guns to give for Security; and yet the Company's Credit not to be worth 2 <hi>d.</hi> is a palpable Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>That any of the Company Mortgaged their Eſtates to raiſe Money, is falſe; they advanc'd it on their own Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, as they might well do, it being well known there are ſeveral of them who have as much yearly Eſtate as the Sum he ſpeaks of: Nor did they deſire the Company's Ships in ſecurity, but only a Bond which it was reaſonable they ſhould have.</p>
                  <p>He comes next to give us an Account of the ſhortneſs of the Proviſions, <hi>P.</hi> 46. and of his own Honeſty in the mean time, in not acquainting the Commadore with it till they were three days at Sea; perhaps he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezel'd them himſelf, or Pocketed ſome of the Money, for he owns that he had ſome time before been concerned in the Victualling part, and therefore dar'd not to ſay any thing of it on Shore, leſt it might have been prov'd upon him; but however that is, this we are ſure of, that the Company had Letters from their Ships at the <hi>Maderas,</hi> that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45975:111"/>they had Twelve Months Proviſions of all ſorts, at ſharp Allowance, and that if any thing fell ſhort, it was likely to be their Bread: That they thought this to be true, may be reaſonably concluded from his own. Narrative, where he ſays the Council upon his Repreſentation, deſign'd to ſend an Expreſs from the <hi>Orkneys,</hi> to acquaint the Company with the ſhortneſs of their Proviſions, which to be ſure they would have done, had they been ſenſible that they were ſo ſhort as he alledges: Beſides, he owns they had full Eleven Months Allowance of Stock-ſiſh at four Days in the Week; when do it is probable that they had other things in proportion.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon why they had no more Beer but Ten Tun, was that the Seamen could not depend on the Beer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſpoils, they had great ſtore of very good Water, and a very great quantity of Brandy which the Libeller takes no notice of. As for the Company's promiſing them Credit at the <hi>Maderas,</hi> it is falſe; nor was there any need of it, they had Pipe Staves and other Goods, which were thought proper for the <hi>Maderas,</hi> but if it did not anſwer, ſo well as 'twas expected, 'twas but the common Misfortune of Merchants, who many times meet with ſuch diſappointments. Nor is it to be expected that a Nation of ſo little Experience in Trade as ours, ſhould at firſt ſetting out, be free from Miſtakes or Miſmanagement, eſpecially ſince we have ſuch Invective Enemics to deal with who make it their buſineſs to get ill Men amongſt us every where, on purpoſe to break our Deſign.</p>
                  <p>His next Reflection is on the ſmall Allowance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money, which is ſufficiently anſwer'd when we tell him their Cargo was reckon'd inſtead of it, and as has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid, muſt needs be conceiv'd to be very proper for a Country where People go naked for want of Apparel. They had an great deal of Butter, and excellent Beef, of Scots Breed, by which we gain'd an Experiment contrary to the common Notion; for upon trial it was found to be better than the Iriſh, and therefore our Men teſolv'd to keep it laſt. His Objection as to its having been Eighteen Months in Salt is frivolous. Scamen think nothing of that when they can carry Beef to the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> and back again, and keep it good all the while. His Change upon <hi>Drummelier</hi> as having bought damnified. Wheat for their
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45975:111"/>Bread, and put the Money in his Poket, is malicious and falſe: There's no Man but one of the Renegadoes Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that can ſuſpect that Worthy Gentleman to be capable of any ſuch thing. Beſides, the Bread was extraordinary good.</p>
                  <p>His Story, p. 50. about <hi>Crab-Iſland,</hi> is falſe; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany gave no poſitive Orders to leave any Men there, and its equally falſe that the <hi>Danes</hi> prevented our taking Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, our Men were there before the <hi>Danes</hi> came from St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Governour of which ſuſpecting our Deſign, upon the arrival of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi> there, ſent an Officer and Fifteen Men to Aſſert the King of <hi>Danmark</hi>'s Right, after our Men went off from the Place, they ſaw the Daniſh Sloop in another Bay of the ſame Iſland call'd <hi>French-Man</hi>'s <hi>Bay,</hi> and a Tent aſhore with Daniſh Colours on it; upon which Captain <hi>Pennicook</hi> Landed again, told them we were Poſſeſſed before them, againſt which they offer'd their Proteſt to pleaſe the Court of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but wiſh'd with all their Hearts we might ſettle there, for we ſhould be a good Bulwark to them againſt the Spaniards of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tc-Rico,</hi> who are very troubleſome Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>It is falſe what he ſays p. 54. That Captain <hi>Andreas,</hi> after looking upon us at firſt. Landing, did not come near us in three or four Weeks, for he came aboard us at firſt with ſome of his Men on the 2d of <hi>November,</hi> and brought his Travelling Wife with him on the 3d of <hi>November,</hi> when he came on Board again, and was very well ſatisfied with us; and on the 10th of the ſame Month, he and his Son, Wife and Siſter, Din'd on Board us. And on the 30th of <hi>November</hi> he was invited on Board, handſomly. Treated, and after having given a Rational Vindication of himſelf, as to the Matter ſuggeſted againſt him by the other <hi>Danien</hi> Captains or Princes; and being inform'd of our real De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which before he ſuſpected to be Piracy, he deſir'd a Commiſſion from us, which was readily Granted and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Accepted; and he ſolemnly promis'd to Defend us to the laſt drop of his Blood. That his Commiſſion was left behind him in the Locker of the Round-Houſe, cram'd in amongſt empty Bottles, we have nothing but this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado's Word for it: but admitting it to be ſo, it does not therefore neceſſarily follow, that it was left there by <hi>Andreas,</hi> or his Order; it is not to be ſuppos'd that a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45975:112"/>Perſon of his Note, could creep into the Round-Houſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcover'd: and perhaps it may be no unreaſonable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, to think that it was ſtole from him, and lodg'd there by this Renegado; for he owns that it was himſelf that found it, and he knows the Proverb, <hi>He that hides knows beſt where to find.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Story about <hi>Andreas</hi>'s <hi>Exit, P.</hi> 60. That he fell, or was thrown down the Main Hatch-way of the <hi>Caledonia</hi> in the Night time, after a Quarrel with <hi>Ambroſio,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of thoſe <hi>Indian</hi> Captains, has ſuch an Air of Malice and Falſhood, that it requires better Evidence than that of a ſelf-contradicting Libeller, before it can obtain belief with any Rational Man, or allowing it to be true, that he was actually tumbled down the Hatch-way in the Night time, it looks more like the Practice of ſuch a Quarrelſome ill natur'd Perſon as himſelf, than of any Body elſe. They that know his Behaviour to his own Captain, when he was Surgeon on Board one of the King's Ships, his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with Captain <hi>Pennicook,</hi> Commadore of our Ships that went to <hi>Darien,</hi> and the whole Tenor of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, cannot think this any uncharitable Reflection. His unnatutal Rancor againſt his Native Country, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Malice againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> Company, make it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable enough that he might do ſuch a thing on purpoſe to render the Natives Enemies to the Colony; which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted himſelf about a Month after: And this is ſo much the more probable, becauſe he exclaims againſt thoſe on Board, for not taking care of <hi>Andreas,</hi> nor letting him blood after his fall, ſince none was ſo proper to do it as himſelf, who was a Surgeon, and on Board the Ship at the time.</p>
                  <p>It is needleſs to inſiſt any further on his Train of Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods and Inconſiſtencies in his Account of the Country, which being contrary, not only to all that have wrote of it, but alſo to the Journals and Letters ſent from our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. We have better reaſon to ſay, that his Deſcription is Calculated to the Humour of our Enemies, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orners, than that the Colony's and Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi>'s Accounts were Calculated to the Meridian of the <hi>Scots</hi> Company. To put this Matter out of all doubt, we ſhall here ſubjoin the firſt Letter ſent from <hi>Caledonia</hi> by the Council of the Colony to the Company, which is the Teſtimony of ſix againſt one.</p>

                                 <hi>The Wealth, Fruitfulneſs, Health and good Situation of the Country proves for the better, much above our greateſt Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which God Almighty ſeems to have wonderfully reſerv'd for this Occaſion, and now to have prepar'd our Way, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the</hi> Indies <hi>to that purpoſe. In our Paſſage hither ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of our Number have been taken from us by Death (whoſe Names we have herewith ſent you) and whereof the loſs of our two Miniſters is the moſt ſenſible to us. We therefore intreat you would uſe your utmoſt endeavours with the General Aſſembly, for procuring others so ſupply that great want: As to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we find it very healthful; for although we arriv'd here in the Rainy Seaſon, from which we had little or no ſhelter for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Weeks together, and many Sick among us, yet they are ſo far recover'd, and in ſo good a State of Health as could hardly any where be expected among ſuch a number of Men together; nor know we any thing here of thoſe ſeveral dangerous and mortal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers ſo prevalent in the Engliſh and other American Iſlands.</hi>

                  <p>This being from Men who knew the Miſrepreſentation of the Affair, muſt needs Iſſue in their own Ruin, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuſpected of diſingenuity; and therefore muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly over-balance the Evidence of a Renegado, who owns that he writes out of Malice.</p>
                  <p>The firſt defence he puts in the Company's Mouthis, their being baulk'd of Foreign Subſcriptions, which made them loſe Time and Money, whereby they could not ſend out ſuch a number of Men and quantity of Proviſions as the Project would have required. This is litterally true, let <hi>H—s</hi> and his Suborniers anſwer it if they can. As for his Queſtion, Why did they prodigally throw away 50000 <hi>l</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> purely to make a Blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45975:114"/>there; and why did they truſt to another Man's Purſe till ſuch time as they are ſure of it? We ſhall anſwer by asking him another Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Since he pretends to know the Secrets of the Weſt end of the Town, why did our Government oppoſe our taking Foreign Subſcriptions, ſince they had impowered us by Acts of Parliament, and Letters Pattent to take them, and ſince twas ſuch a thing as the like perhaps was never done; what reaſon had we to ſuſpect being baulk'd of our Foreign Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? He himſelf own'd that the Hollanders and Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers were fond of our Project, till our Government oppos'd us; and therefore, by his own Confeſſion, they are to blame for thoſe diſappointments. As to our taking Subſcriptions in <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi> We had reaſon to engage as many of our Proteſtant Neighbours in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign as we could, that we might be the more able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelves in caſe of Oppoſition; which is neither ill Policy, nor inconſiſtent with Honeſty.</p>
                  <p>The 2d Defence he puts in their Mouth, That their Ships were Man'd, no Proviſions to be had in <hi>Scotland,</hi> more were providing abroad, and no more Money to be had from the Subſcribers till once the Ships were Sail'd, is ſuch as he and his Suborners will never be able to anſwer; What could the Company do more, than take care to have Proviſions abroad, when none were to be had at home.? And if the Subſcribers would pay no more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney till the Ships put to Sea, there was a neceſſity of Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His Objection as to the ſhortneſs of their Proviſions, we have anſwer'd already, and ſhall add which he mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly conceals; That we ſent a Ship with Proviſions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, which was caſt away in <hi>January,</hi> for which we cannot be anſwerable; and he himſelf owns we ſent another Convoy in <hi>May;</hi> Then ſince the Colony ſent us Advice from the <hi>Maderas,</hi> dated <hi>Aug.</hi> 29. That they had ſtill 8 Months large, and twelve Months ſhort Allowance: The Company cannot juſtly be accus'd of ſupine Neglect, when they ſent away one Ship with Proviſions four Months after this notice, and two more in five Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, conſidering that they had no Proviſions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the Libeller himſelf owns; and that the Colony had a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go which might have bought them Proviſions either from the Natives, if they had any to ſpare, which we could not doubt of by Mr. <hi>Wafer</hi>'s Deſcription, or from the Engliſh Colonies, had it not not been for the Proclamation, which
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45975:114"/>we had no reaſon to ſuſpect would be iſſued at all, and much leſs in ſuch a manner, in the Name of our own Prince, who was oblig'd to Protect us.</p>
                  <p>To the Cauſes he aſſigns for the Sailing of our Fleer without a greater quantity of Proviſions, we <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>! add one more, <hi>viz.</hi> That we had reaſon to fear that our Enemies might prevent us; which Captain <hi>Long</hi>'s being on thoſe Coaſts a Month before us, ſhews was not without Ground; no more than our Suſpicion, that endeayours were uſed to ſurprize us into a War with the Spaniards, by <hi>Long</hi>'s Men killing ſeven of them, as hath been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; and of his doing all he could to make us odious to the Natives, by telling them we were Pirates, and diſobliging both <hi>Ambroſio</hi> and <hi>Diego,</hi> by ſordid little Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his own, as Captain <hi>Pennicook</hi> gave us an Accoun in his Journal. A Grave Member of the Committee of Trade can give a more full Account of this, if he pleaſes; and when his hand is in, he would do well to aſſign us a Reaſon why that barbarous Murder committed by <hi>Long</hi>'s Men, was never yet taken notice of by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, ſince they have publiſhed ſuch angry Memorials againſt us, who committed no Hoſtilities upon them.</p>
                  <p>His Objection to the third and fourth Reaſon relating to the Honeſty of our Deſign, and the Cargoes not being proper, we have anſwer'd already. As for that of our Goods being ſeizable in <hi>Jamaica</hi> and other Engliſh Plantations, by the Act of Navigation, it's one of the Hardſhips we juſtly complain of, that was put upon us by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mics of our Nation in <hi>Charles</hi> II's Reign. But allowing it to be reaſonable, it cannot have ſo much Equity in it, as the Laws which make it puniſhable by Death, to Roband Murder. Yet the Execution of thoſe are many times diſpenc'd with in favour of Criminals, by his Majeſty; and indeed a Power to diſpence with the Execution of Law ſometimes, to ſave the Life of a Subject, is one of the moſt Innocent Branches of the Prerogative; but we had much more reaſon to have expected a Diſpenſation in this Caſe, to ſave the Lives of ſo many of his Subjects, who had generouſly venter'd them for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>His owning, <hi>p.</hi> 148. and 154. That a Cargo of Proviſions brought by two <hi>Jamaica</hi> Sloops, was bought by the Colony, beſides as many Turtle as came to 100 and odd Pounds. for which he owns the Colony paid em; not only
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45975:115"/>contradicts what he ſays almoſt in the ſame breath, <hi>That there was neither Money no Moneys worth to be had in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony;</hi> and that they laid out all their Stock of Ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for Wine at <hi>Maderas, p.</hi> 48. but may, together with their having both Proviſions and Money when they came to <hi>New York,</hi> juſtly confirm our Suſpicion, that there was a Miſmanagement of the Proviſions; ſince two Sloop's Cargo of Proviſion, 27 Pipes of Wine, 100 Pounds worth of Turtle, the Fiſh Plantains, Bonanoes, Potatoes, Indian Corn, Sojours, or Land Crabs, which he ſays were plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful at firſt' added to their former Proviſions which they own'd they had at the <hi>Maderas;</hi> together with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their Number of Men by Death was not enough to keep their Colony from ſtarving for Nine Months. We have ſtill the more reaſon to ſuſpect this, becauſe the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>New York,</hi> which brought us the firſt certain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Diſaſter of our Colony, hinted as if <hi>there might be ſome Work for the Hangman.</hi> That there were more ill Men in the Colony than <hi>H—s</hi> is probable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: and particularly that <hi>Pennicook</hi> was brib'd to raiſe Diviſions in the Colony, and put all in diſorder by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence: which falling in with the Proclamations that were concerted for our Deſtruction, gave a handle to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill Men to foment the Diviſions, and compleat the Ruin of the Colony by a total Deſertion.</p>
                  <p>His Inſinuation, <hi>P.</hi> 154, That two <hi>Jamaica</hi> Sloops with Proviſions return'd from the Colony without breaking bulk, becauſe there was neither Money nor Market Goods there; deſerves better Evidence than his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it obtain Credit. We have indeed heard of one Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel with Proviſions, which inſiſted on ſuch extravagant Rates, that the Colony would not incourage them to do the like in time to come; and therefore would not deal with them: hoping that their own Convoy might ſpeedily come up; but this was before they knew any thing of the Ploclamation, which cut off all their future hopes, ev'n from <hi>Scotland.</hi> We have alſo Letters from <hi>New York,</hi> that the Government of that Place ſeem'd to intend them no good; of which their deſiring our Ships to come and Anchor under the Guns of the Caſtle, is a clear Proof; and the reaſon of this unkind Treatment is alſo explain'd to us, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſuſpected our Men had a deſign to return back as ſoon as they got Proviſions. Nay, we
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45975:115"/>have had advice, that their Gold Duſt was actually reſus'd at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> becauſe of the Proclamations which we have reaſon enough to believe: ſince we cannot think that the It habitants there would be willing to incurr the height of His Majeſty's Diſpleaſure to oblige the Scots. That our Men had Gold Duſt from the Natives for Powder, Shot, and ſpeckled Shifts: the Libeller owns himſelf, <hi>P.</hi> 149. and there he brags of it, that he brought off more him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at 3 <hi>l</hi> 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Ounce, (how he came by it, is worth the inquiry) than moſt of the Councellors that are come home ſince; and by Letters from <hi>New York,</hi> we have heard there was Money amongſt them: By all which 'tis evident, That want of Money or Goods was not the ſole Cauſe of their being demed Proviſions from the Engliſh Plantations. His Inſinuation, that the French and Dutch Iſlands would have ſupplied us if we had had Money or Goods, is ridiculous; when the Government of both thoſe Nations had ſo expreſly declared themſelves againſt us.</p>
                  <p>His All gation in that ſame Page, that His Majeſty knew nothing of the Colonies Settlement at <hi>Darien,</hi> but what he had at ſecond hand, &amp;c. till the Spanith Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur told him from his Maſter, is ſo notoriouſly falſe, that none but a Perſon of his Forehead could have advanced it, when the World knows that the Proclamation againſt us was publiſh'd in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> and the Spaniſh Memorial was not deliver'd till <hi>May</hi> following. We ſhould indeed be very glad to find that His Majeſty knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thoſe Proclamations; and that his Name was made uſe of without his Conſent; as ſome ſay his Grandfathers was in the Iriſh Maſſacre: for then we might reaſonably expect ſpeedy Juſtice upon thoſe bold Offenders, who dar'd to publiſh ſuch Proclamations in His Majeſty's Name, wherein we are condemned; as having invaded the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish D<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>maniens before ever it was heard what we could ſay for our ſelves, or without giving us any notice of thoſe Proclamations, that we might have taken care to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd our Men from being ſtarv'd to death by them: By which they have made our Prince to act more like our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Enemy, than one that we had conſtantly lov'd and rever'd as Father of his Country: and that which is yet more cutting; they ſtill prevail to miſlead him, ſo as he continues his unnatural Oppoſition to us: For beſides the Proclamations formerly mentioned, another has been ſince
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45975:116"/>publiſh'd againſt us in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> dated <hi>Sept.</hi> 15, which is ſo much the more unaccountable; conſidering the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial given in by our Preſident and Advocate, juſtifying our Pretenſions which the Spaniards have never yet offered to anſwer. By means of this Proclamation, the St. <hi>Andrew</hi> was denied Relief when ſhe fell in with Admirel <hi>Bembo,</hi> who told her, tho they ſhould all ſtarve he could allow them none, and the like anſwer they had from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> tho they offer'd Goods in Exchange; the like Oppoſition is alſo continued againſt us at home; for tho the Company have addreſs'd His Majeſty, yet'tis without effect. After a full Repreſentation of their Loſſes, they did wiſely and dutifully deſire the Parliament might meet, that being the proporeſt way to have the ſinking Honour of the Company ſupported; but His Majeſty inſtead of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their reaſonable deſires, was prevail'd upon by thoſe who are Enemies to our Country, to prorogue it further at the very time when they knew the Addreſs was coming up, and all the Anſwer thought ſit to give them, is, <hi>That His Majeſty is ſorry for the loſs of his Ancient Kingdom and of the Company, that they ſhall have the ſame liberty to trade to the</hi> Weſt-Indies <hi>as formerly; and that he will call the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament when he thinks the good of the Nation requires it,</hi> or to that effect. It may eaſily be judged, that this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer could be no way ſatisfactory to the Company in ſuch a Juncture: nor are we to wonder, if inſtead of cheering their Spirits, it ſtruck them dumb, and fill'd them with Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We wiſh that thoſe who adviſe His Majeſty to ſuch a Conduct towards the People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been backward in teſtifying their Loyalty and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Perſon and Government; would conſider that this is a downright Violation of our Conſtitution. It's certain that none are ſo proper to give his Majeſty advice, when a Parliament is neceſſary as our own Nobility Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Burrowghs, who are moſt of them concern'd in our Company: and therefore their Addreſs ought to haye been more regarded than the advice of any particular Perſons.</p>
                  <p>This falſe Method of Government hath ruin'd many of our Princes, and we wiſh that thoſe who put his Majeſty upon ſuch Meaſures, may not have his ruin in proſpect. It is certain they can be none of his Friends, who put him upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging of the whole Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> in this manner.</p>
                  <p>We come next to the Libeller's Defence of the Spaniſh
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45975:116"/>Title to <hi>Darien,</hi> p. 163. His firſt Argument, That the Spaniards Title to that Country was never hitherto diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any Prince or State, is a downright Falſhood. The <hi>Darien</hi> Princes themſelves controverted it always, and their Plea was allow'd to be good by the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> as we have been fore'd to tell this Renegado and his Suborners again and again. The Title of the Spaniards as Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to any part of <hi>America,</hi> is not only doubted by the Biſhop of <hi>Cheapo, Don Bartholomew de Los Caſas,</hi> mention'd in the Defence of the Scots Settlement, but ſtrenuouſly argu'd againſt and maitain'd to be unlawful, in his Propoſitions concerning the Title of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>America,</hi> propos'd to the Conſideration of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> himſelf. In his ninth Propoſition he aſſerts, <q>That when Chriſtian Princes apply their Endeavours to propagate the Faith, they ought to have no Conſideration for any thing but the Service of God—Or if they can do any thing for the advantage of their Dominions while they augment the Kingdom of Chriſt: It ought to be without any conſiderable prejudice to the Infidels or the Princes that Govern them—<hi>Prop.</hi> 10. He aſſerts, They have their own lawful Kings and Princes, who have a Right to to make Laws, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>— For the good Government of their reſpective Dominions, ſo that they cannot beexpell'd out of 'em, or depriv'd of what they poſſeſs, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Violence to the Laws of God as well as the Law of Nations. <hi>Prop.</hi> 26. Seeing the Spaniards have not been ſupported either by the Authority of their Prince, or any lawful Reaſon to make War againſt the Indians, who liv'd peaceably in their own Country, and had done the Spaniard no wrong; all ſuch Conqueſts that have been or may hereafter be made in the <hi>Indies,</hi> are to be accounted Unjuſt, Tyranical and Null, being condemned by all the Laws of God and Men.</q> Its true he ſuppoſes the K. of <hi>Spain</hi> to have a Title to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of the Indies, by the Popes Grant; but it is with ſuch Reſtrictions as thoſe he mentions; and in his 16 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſays the Pope, has power to revoke it, if it be found prejudicial to the Eſtabliſhment of the Faith; and he expreſly declares throughout his Book, that all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods taken by the Spaniards were ſuch, ſo that here's one ſtrong Evidence of their own againſt them.—<hi>Dominicus de Soto;</hi> the K. of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Confeſſor at the time ſcems by his ſumming up the Diſpute betwixt this Biſhop and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45975:117"/>Dr. <hi>Sepulveda</hi> to have been of the ſame Opinion; and <hi>Sepulveda</hi>'s Books, maintaining the contrary were ſnppreſs'd by the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſame Opinion, and indeed more expreſs againſt the Methods, by which the Spaniards acquir'd their Dominions in the Indies, is, <hi>Franciſcus a Victoria,</hi> chief Profeſſor of Divinity, in the Univerſity of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> (whom the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. conſulted in Caſes of Conſcience, and in this amongſt others) as may be ſeen in his <hi>Relectiones, Theologicae, Relectione 5. de Indis</hi> where he argues the Point at large, and in <hi>Relect.</hi> 7. <hi>de jure bell,</hi> lays down this as a Maxim, <hi>That an Injury receiv'd is the only juſt Cauſe of making War.</hi> So that it being plain from Matter of Fact that the Indians did no manner of Injury to the Spaniards; their War upon them muſt of neceſſity by this Argumnt be unlawful. More has been ſaid already in Vindication of our Tide, in the defence of the Scots Settlement, than the Renegado and his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borners can anſwer; therefore we ſhall wind up this Matter in a few Words more.</p>
                  <p>His alledging we might as well land in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> where the wild Negroes have deſerted their Maſters, or in <hi>Tobago, &amp;c.</hi> ſerve only to diſcover his own Folly. There's no unconquer'd Natives, who have their own Princes to govern them in either of thoſe Iſlands, nor are the Titles of the Engliſh and D. of <hi>Curland,</hi> to thoſe Places queſtion'd. The Iriſh having admitted French Troops into their Kingdom is as little to the purpoſe, ſince they have had no ſhadow of Government or Sovereignty, left them for ſeveral Ages, have from time to time ſubmitted to the Government of <hi>England,</hi> and admitted thoſe Troops in defence of the late K. <hi>James</hi>'s Title, which he derives from <hi>Hen.</hi> II. that Conqner'd them. Beſides, the Libeller himſselt owns, p. 54. that the Natives themſelves were pleas'd with the hopes of being reſtor'd by us to their Ancient Liberty and Greatneſs; and p. 55. That <hi>Ambroſio</hi> one of their greateſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, was at War with the Spaniards before our Arrival. His al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging that Cap. <hi>Andreas</hi> was a Spaniſh Captain at the time of our Landing, needs better proof than his affertion: that he might be then at Peace with the Spaniards, and have ſome reſpect for them becauſe of his being bred among them, as <hi>H</hi>—ſays he was, p. 60. all that they then gave him a Commiſſion as a Captain, does not at all argue that he was in the Spaniſh Intereſt when we Landed, or any way ſubject to the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> if he himſelf promiſed ſubjection, it does not diveſt his Subjects of their Right, and that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas</hi>'s Succeſſlor and they were no Friends to the Spaniards, is evident from the Libeller's own Story, that they gave cur Colony motice of the Spaniſh Party that came to view them, and led them to the place where they were: We have likwiſe the Teſtimony of all that have writ of this Place, againſt the Renegado, beſides that of the Journals of our own Colony, which give an Account that <hi>An broſio</hi> had engag'd all his Neighbouring Princes in a League a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spaniard, before our Arrival.</p>
